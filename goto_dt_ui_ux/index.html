<li>The book "Designing for Emotion" by Aarron Walter is about creating emotional connections with users through design.</li>
<li>Designing for emotion can lead to increased user engagement, loyalty, and overall satisfaction with a product or service.</li>
<li>The book covers topics such as understanding user emotions, using visual cues to convey emotion, and creating a narrative in design.</li>
<li>Aarron Walter emphasizes the importance of empathy in design, and encourages designers to put themselves in their users' shoes.</li>
<li>He also discusses the concept of "anticipatory design," where designers try to predict and address user needs before they arise.</li>
<li>The book includes examples of successful emotional design in various industries, such as social media, e-commerce, and gaming.</li>
<li>Aarron Walter encourages designers to continue learning and developing their skills in order to create better experiences for users.</li>

<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attention is a limited resource and can be easily disrupted by irrelevant information or stimuli.</li>
<li>There are several types of attention including selective, divided, and sustained attention.</li>
<li>Cognitive overload occurs when there is too much information to process at once, leading to decreased performance and productivity.</li>
<li>Designing for attention involves minimizing distractions, providing clear instructions, and allowing users to focus on one task at a time.</li>
<li>For screen readers and sighted users, it's important to consider what you're asking people's attention to do and to carefully manage their cognitive load.</li>
<li>The website <a href="https://howiexperiencewebtoday.com/">https://howiexperiencewebtoday.com/</a> provides a good example of how not to design for attention.</li>

<li>The guest, Raghavendra Kambhampati, is a Senior Director of Engineering at Okta.</li>
<li>He has been in the tech industry for over 20 years and has seen many changes in how software is developed and delivered.</li>
<li>One of the biggest changes he has noticed is the shift from monolithic architectures to microservices.</li>
<li>This change has allowed for more flexibility and scalability in software development, but it also requires a different approach to testing and debugging.</li>
<li>Another change is the rise of DevOps and the importance of collaboration between developers and operations teams.</li>
<li>Kambhampati believes that the future of software development will involve even more automation and machine learning.</li>
<li>He thinks that the role of developers will shift towards more creative problem-solving, while machines will handle the routine tasks.</li>
<li>When asked about his advice for new engineers, Kambhampati emphasizes the importance of continuous learning and adapting to change.</li>
<li>He also encourages engineers to be curious and ask questions, as well as to build strong relationships with their colleagues.</li>
<li>Finally, when asked about what he would take from the past and bring to the present or future, Kambhampati says that he would like to see more connection with nature in our lives, even in the tech industry.</li>

<ul>
<li>Server-driven UI is a design pattern where the layout and behavior of a user interface are controlled by a server rather than locally on the client.</li>
<li>This approach can be useful for implementing complex features or for providing dynamic content to users.</li>
<li>To convert a feature to be server driven, you will need to do the following:</li>
<li>Design an api that serves json data for your feature.</li>
<li>Write client-side code to consume this json and render the ui based on it.</li>
<li>Set up a way to test your implementation to ensure it's working correctly.</li>
<li>When deciding whether or not to convert a feature to be server driven, consider the following:</li>
<li>Is it always going to be worth the work to convert a feature to be server driven?</li>
<li>What are some of the best ways to test your ui is it sufficient to have just unit tests or do we still need full end-to-end ui tests?</li>
<li>Some benefits of using server-driven UI include:</li>
<li>It allows you to decouple your front-end and back-end code, making it easier to maintain.</li>
<li>It enables you to provide dynamic content to users without having to update the client-side code.</li>
<li>It can improve the performance of your application by reducing the amount of data that needs to be downloaded to the client.</li>

<ul>
<li>Persuasive design is the practice of designing interfaces that influence user behavior.</li>
<li>It can be used to manipulate users (coercion) or facilitate intrinsic motivation (persuasion).</li>
<li>Coercion involves using persuasive techniques to get users to do something they might not otherwise want to do, while persuasion is about helping users achieve their own goals.</li>
<li>Persuasive design can be used for both short-term and long-term user engagement.</li>
<li>Short-term engagement tactics include things like rewards, social proof, and loss aversion, while long-term engagement tactics involve creating a sense of autonomy, competence, and relatedness in users.</li>
<li>To use persuasive design effectively, it's important to understand the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation.</li>
<li>Extrinsic motivation comes from external factors like rewards or social pressure, while intrinsic motivation comes from within and is driven by a desire to achieve a goal for its own sake.</li>
<li>Persuasive design can be used to create interfaces that encourage users to engage in positive behaviors, such as exercising regularly or eating healthy foods.</li>
<li>However, it's important to use persuasive design ethically and responsibly, as it can also be used to manipulate users into making decisions that may not be in their best interests.</li>
<li>To ensure that persuasive design is used ethically, it's important to be transparent with users about how their data is being collected and used, and to give them control over their own behavior.</li>

<li>Users' expectations have increased over the years and they become more demanding as they see more apps.</li>
<li>Testing on multiple devices is a challenge due to the variety of Androids and iPhones available.</li>
<li>Cross-platform testing is important to ensure functionality across all platforms.</li>
<li>AppsFlyer uses a system that takes screenshots during automated tests to quickly identify broken functionalities.</li>
<li>Most projects at AppsFlyer run two-week sprints, with some running one-week sprints which is too short.</li>

<li>User interface design is about creating a system that allows people to achieve their goals in the best way possible</li>
<li>The key to successful user interface design is understanding the users and their needs, as well as the context in which the system will be used</li>
<li>When designing a user interface, it's important to keep in mind the principles of usability, accessibility, and inclusivity</li>
<li>It's also important to consider the overall user experience, including the visual design and branding of the system</li>
<li>Some common techniques for user interface design include user research, wireframing, prototyping, and user testing</li>
<li>When it comes to designing mobile apps, it's important to consider the unique constraints and opportunities presented by mobile devices</li>
<li>It's also important to keep in mind the principles of good mobile app design, such as simplicity, clarity, and intuitiveness</li>
<li>Some common challenges in user interface design include working with complex data, integrating with existing systems, and accommodating diverse user needs</li>
<li>To overcome these challenges, it can be helpful to collaborate with other designers, developers, and stakeholders, and to use tools and techniques such as user research, prototyping, and user testing.</li>
