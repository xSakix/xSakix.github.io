<li>
<p>Intro: The speakers discuss the US Digital Service's role in delivering better government services using technology, design, and user experience. They mention that they will talk about three projects: Vaccines.gov, Cova Test.gov, and SRE for pandemic response.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vaccines.gov: The speaker talks about how they built a tool to help people find vaccine appointment availability by creating a searchable map with information on available appointments. They mention that the project was launched in two months and had 1101 million sessions in 2021, serving 736 million users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cova Test.gov: The speaker discusses how they built an online platform for ordering at-home COVID tests, which involved scaling up to distribute 500 million tests across the US. They highlight that the project was launched within two months and had 150 million addresses distributed across the country.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SRE for Pandemic Response: The speaker talks about how they used Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) principles to ensure that government websites could handle high traffic loads during key events like presidential announcements or vaccine rollouts. They mention that they used a "soft launch" approach, where they would gradually release new features to users while monitoring performance and making adjustments as needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Key Takeaways: Some key takeaways from the talk include the importance of collaboration across different organizations and government agencies, the need for clear communication and alignment around project goals, and the value of using SRE principles to ensure that digital services can scale effectively during times of high demand. Additionally, the speakers emphasize the importance of user-centered design and continuous improvement in delivering better government services.</p>

<li>Title: Metastable Failure - A Surprising Cascading Failure Story</li>
<li>Presenter: Kyle, Senior Production Engineer at Meta</li>
<li>The speaker describes a memorable incident in his career that he refers to as "metastable failure". He explains the term and contrasts it with cascading failure.</li>
<li>A metastable failure is when a system enters a bad state due to a trigger cause, stays in this bad state even after the trigger is removed, and becomes unusable. The sustaining effect prevents the system from self-recovering.</li>
<li>The speaker shares his experience of an incident that could have been a cascading failure but was actually a metastable failure. He explains how he and his team discovered this and what they did to recover from it.</li>
<li>They found that the incident was caused by a combination of factors: a machine crashing, another machine going unhealthy while still running, and a health check affecting load shedding causing traffic oscillation.</li>
<li>The speaker describes how they mitigated the incident by making some changes to their design and configuration. They made explicit choices to count machines as healthy only if they pass certain thresholds, spread traffic evenly across machines instead of overloading remaining ones, and adjusted weight for periodic automated recalculation.</li>
<li>He also recommends understanding behavior systems and how they work, as well as spreading traffic across services to avoid overloading surviving services and causing cascading failures.</li>

<li>Adaptive capacity is the ability of a system to prepare, plan, and absorb changes while recovering successfully from adverse conditions.</li>
<li>Resilience is the ability to sustain adaptations in response to changing conditions.</li>
<li>Complex software systems are sociotechnical, meaning they involve both human and machine components.</li>
<li>The mental model represents the cognitive representation of an external reality.</li>
<li>A system's resilience depends on its capacity to adapt failure.</li>
<li>Conducting a chaos experiment, or simulating a scenario like conducting a disaster recovery test, can help reveal how a system behaves under pressure and identify areas for improvement.</li>
<li>Security Chaos Engineering is about enabling organizations to gracefully respond to failures and adapt evolving conditions.</li>
<li>A decision tree is a visual representation of different actions and events that can help map out potential outcomes and inform iterative design improvements.</li>
<li>Conducting experiments, like injecting logging statements or changing system configurations, can provide valuable insights into how a system behaves under stress and identify areas for improvement.</li>
<li>Continuously refining mental models and understanding of system realities is essential to sustaining resilience in complex software systems.</li>

<li>Elijah Andrews of Datadog presented a talk about troubleshooting a DNS issue in Kubernetes.</li>
<li>The issue was that rolling restarts of the metric service were causing errors and high error rates.</li>
<li>The speaker discovered that the problem was not actually with DNS, but rather with the way that Kubernetes handles networking.</li>
<li>In Kubernetes, each pod gets its own IP address, and when a pod is deleted, it can take some time for the network to update. This can cause issues if multiple pods are trying to connect to the same service at once.</li>
<li>The speaker also discovered that there was a limit on the number of DNS requests that could be made per second, which was causing some requests to fail.</li>
<li>To fix the issue, the speaker increased the memory allocated to the local DNS process and adjusted some networking settings.</li>
<li>The speaker also used network traffic analysis tools to identify the root cause of the problem.</li>
<li>In conclusion, the speaker emphasized the importance of understanding both the underlying technology and the specific use case when troubleshooting complex issues like this one.</li>

<p>URL: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJWkUWCYx7g">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJWkUWCYx7g</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Intro: Nick Travalini, a Technical Customer Success Manager at Honeycomb.io, is presenting on the 1979 NORAD nuclear near miss during a conference.</li>
<li>Main points:<ul>
<li>The story begins with World War II and the development of analog computers to control various things like antiaircraft ballistic missile systems.</li>
<li>By the mid-1950s, digital technology started gaining traction, especially in military contexts such as command and control systems.</li>
<li>This led to the creation of the SAGE (Semi-Automatic Ground Environment) system, which was a large-scale computerized command and control communication system used for early warning systems during the Cold War era.</li>
<li>The story then moves towards the 1970s when the NORAD alliance was established to detect incoming enemy attacks across the continental north of America.</li>
<li>In October 1979, an incident occurred where a test data reel was mistakenly used instead of a tagged nuclear attack data reel in the Honeywell computer system at Cheyenne Mountain Complex. This led to a false alarm that a nuclear missile was incoming.</li>
<li>The near-miss event highlights the importance of understanding the sociotechnical systems we work with and questioning the data we receive from them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Conclusion:<ul>
<li>Nick encourages everyone to think critically about the information they receive, especially when dealing with complex systems like distributed computer networks. He also points out that even though the NORAD system has improved since the 1979 incident, there's still room for improvement in terms of asking critical questions and engaging in thoughtful discussions around technology and its impact on society.</li>

<p>URL: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zgOCkneV6I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zgOCkneV6I</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Introduction: Chad Todd introduces himself and his background in the tech industry. He mentions working at Handover Communications, a company that focuses on researching and developing software for efficient communication during high-stakes situations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Background of Handover Communications: Chad explains that Handover Communications was initially founded to help operators communicate effectively during high-stress scenarios. The concept originated from NASA, where researchers observed the need for quick operator handovers in mission-critical situations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evolution of Handover Communications: Over time, the concept of Handover Communications has evolved beyond verbal communication between two people and now includes digital written communication platforms like Slack and Microsoft Teams. This evolution has been driven by the increasing use of technology in various industries, as well as the need for more efficient and effective ways to share information during handovers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Research on Handover Communications: Chad discusses his research into Handover Communications, which involved conducting interviews with engineers who work in different departments within organizations. He found that there is a lot of inconsistency in how handovers are conducted across different departments, and this can lead to confusion and miscommunication among team members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confidence and Handover Communications: Chad talks about the importance of confidence when it comes to conducting effective handovers. He explains that engineers who feel confident in their ability to communicate during handovers are more likely to provide accurate and helpful information to their colleagues. This, in turn, can help improve overall team performance and reduce the risk of errors or mistakes being made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Departmental Background and Handover Communications: Chad discusses how different departments within organizations have different needs when it comes to conducting handovers.

<h2 id="title-adaptive-universe-the-complexity-of-systems-and-incidents">Title: Adaptive Universe: The Complexity of Systems and Incidents</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Adaptive Universe model proposes that a system is always pushed towards its capacity, making it difficult to build extra buffer time.</li>
<li>Change is never-ending in the Adaptive Universe, which makes life harder for SREs as they must constantly adapt to new changes.</li>
<li>Code freeze is often seen as an antipattern, but can be useful when used judiciously to control change within a system.</li>
<li>The complexity of a system increases over time due to the accumulation of past decisions and changes.</li>
<li>Control theory concepts like Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety can be adapted to help manage complexity in systems.</li>
<li>Incident organization often involves adding more complexity to a system, which makes it harder to maintain and operate effectively.</li>
<li>Communication and coordination are essential for solving problems in distributed systems and incident response teams.</li>
<li>Effective communication requires constant repair of misunderstandings and is a difficult problem to solve, especially in remote or hybrid work environments.</li>
<li>Coordinating people to work together effectively within constraints is crucial for managing complexity in systems and operations.</li>
<li>The key takeaway from this talk is that treating skill involved in operation work as a first-class thing and learning to navigate constraints effectively can help manage the complexity of systems and incidents.</li>

<li>Tucker Vento, a resilience engineer at Bloomberg, discusses the importance of chaos engineering in building reliable and resilient systems.</li>
<li>Bloomberg has over 7000 software engineers maintaining one of the largest private networks in the world with high data processing capabilities.</li>
<li>They have formalized their use of chaos engineering to make their systems more resilient.</li>
<li>Chaos engineering allows for a shorter feedback cycle, enabling teams to learn proactively and respond quickly to potential issues before they become problems.</li>
<li>The process involves carefully planning experiments, triggering expected alerts, and validating system expectations with unit tests.</li>
<li>Test Driven Development (TDD) has been proven effective in improving code quality and understanding of systems, but it can sometimes lead to worse code depending on the specific context.</li>
<li>Chaos engineering complements TDD by focusing on resilience and reliability testing early in the development process.</li>
<li>The advantage of applying chaos engineering early in the life cycle is that it allows for better understanding of system behavior and helps identify potential issues before they become major problems.</li>
<li>A real-world example of applying chaos engineering was given using a Kubernetes cluster to build a highly resilient log aggregation architecture.</li>
<li>The process involved writing experiments, triggering failures, and monitoring the system's response to ensure that it could handle unexpected events.</li>
<li>By incorporating chaos engineering into the development process, teams can identify potential issues earlier and make more informed decisions about design choices, leading to better overall system reliability.</li>

<ul>
<li>Prometheus Planet Scale Journey: EBay's Observability Platform</li>
<li>Use Cases:<ul>
<li>Instrumentation: Developers either use managed Frameworks, instrumentation libraries, or baked examples like Prometheus client.</li>
<li>Dashboarding and Visualization: Go application can say "Hey, I need a Prometheus endpoint monitored." Log file can be tailed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Challenges and Lessons Learned:<ul>
<li>Scalability: Given the scale of EBay's metric installation (125 million+ Prometheus endpoints), they needed to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.</li>
<li>Solution: They built a distributed architecture with many smaller Prometheus instances, each responsible for a subset of metrics. This allowed them to distribute load across multiple instances and provide redundancy in case one instance failed.</li>
<li>Query Performance: As the number of time series grew, query performance became a major issue.</li>
<li>Solution: They implemented a distributed query system that pushed queries down to the data source (the Prometheus instances) rather than pulling all the data up to a central server for processing. This significantly reduced the amount of data that needed to be transferred and improved query response times.</li>
<li>Data Consistency: Ensuring that all instances of Prometheus had consistent, up-to-date data was challenging.</li>
<li>Solution: They implemented a replication system that maintained multiple copies of each time series across different instances. This ensured that if one instance failed, the data could be quickly recovered from another instance.</li>
<li>Fan-Out and Federation: As the number of Prometheus instances grew, managing them all became increasingly complex.</li>
<li>Solution: They implemented a federated architecture where each instance was responsible for a specific subset of metrics (e.g., a particular namespace or cluster). This allowed them to manage smaller groups of instances more easily and reduce the complexity of the overall system.</li>
<li>Observability: EBay wanted to provide users with access to raw metric data, as well as pre-processed data like histograms and quantiles.</li>
<li>Solution: They implemented a storage management system that could handle both raw and processed data, and allowed users to query either type of data using the same interface.</li>
<li>Scaling and Performance: As the number of time series grew, they needed to ensure that their system could handle the increased load without compromising performance.</li>
<li>Solution: They implemented a distributed storage system that could scale horbizontally by adding more nodes as needed. This allowed them to handle large amounts of data without sacrificing performance or reliability.</li>
<li>Time Series Data Retention and Compression: As EBay collected more metric data, they needed to find ways to store it efficiently and cost-effectively.</li>
<li>Solution: They implemented a time series database (TSDB) that could compress data using techniques like delta encoding and sharding to distribute data across multiple nodes. This allowed them to store large amounts of data without using excessive storage resources.</li>
<li>Querying and Visualization: EBay wanted to provide users with powerful querying capabilities and intuitive visualizations for their metric data.</li>
<li>Solution: They implemented a query language called PromQL that could be used to create complex queries and visualize the results in tools like Grafana. This allowed users to quickly analyze their data and identify trends or anomalies.</li>
<li>Troubleshooting and Alerting: EBay wanted to provide users with real-time alerts when something went wrong in their system.</li>
<li>Solution: They implemented a monitoring system that could detect unusual patterns in the metric data and trigger alerts when necessary. This allowed users to quickly respond to issues before they became serious problems.</li>
<li>Future Directions and Open Source Contributions: EBay is considering open-sourcing their entire observability platform, which would allow other organizations to benefit from their experience and expertise in building a scalable, reliable, and efficient metric collection and analysis system.</li>
