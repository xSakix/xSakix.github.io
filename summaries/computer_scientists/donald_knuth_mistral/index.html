<ul>
<li>Donald Cant presented a simple proof of Tamar's theorem for set binary trees.</li>
<li>The one-way associative law is a consequence of the associative law in binary trees, which can be encoded using a rotation scheme.</li>
<li>The encoding scheme allows for the derivation of consequences from axioms using reduction techniques.</li>
<li>The Bendix algorithm can be used to prove equality between two expressions given a set of axioms.</li>
<li>The one-way associative law implies that the order of operations in binary trees does not affect the result, as long as they are parenthesized correctly.</li>
<li>Tamar's theorem states that the ordering relation on binary trees is a lattice, meaning it has greatest lower and least upper bounds.</li>
<li>To find the greatest lower bound of two binary trees, take their meet (join) operation, which is the smallest common subtree.</li>
<li>The least upper bound can be found by taking the join of their dual versions and then finding the largest common ancestor.</li>
<li>The encoding scheme allows for efficient computation of these lattice operations using left and right subtree encodings.</li>

<ul>
<li>The speaker is a computer scientist who has attended the Christmas lecture at the University of Wisconsin for over 40 years.</li>
<li>He shares that during each lecture, he learns two new cool things related to computers and art.</li>
<li>In recent years, he's been discussing Twin Trees, a topic from the field of computer science.</li>
<li>Twin Trees are a pair of binary trees where every node has either 0 or 2 children.</li>
<li>The speaker explains that there are two main exercises related to Twin Trees: Baxter permutation and floor plan decomposition.</li>
<li>Baxter permutation is a peculiar property discovered in the study of continuous functions and fixed points.</li>
<li>It's a permutation where the inverse permutation tells you the position of the original number in the permutation.</li>
<li>The speaker discusses two cases of bad configurations for Baxter permutations and provides examples.</li>
<li>He then talks about Pi mutation, which is related to Baxter permutations, and its inverse.</li>
<li>The speaker mentions that Twin Trees can be represented in various ways, including conical form and anticanonical form.</li>
<li>He also discusses the connection between Twin Trees and floor plans, using examples of room numbers and channel modules.</li>

<ul>
<li>The speaker introduces the concept of exact covering problems and provides an example using a toy problem.</li>
<li>The goal is to choose one option for each primary item that exactly covers all options for secondary items.</li>
<li>The example involves choosing colors for five items (p, q, R, X, Y) with various options (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon).</li>
<li>The speaker discusses the traditional method of solving exact covering problems using a doubly linked list data structure.</li>
<li>This method uses pointers to neighbors and is less efficient than dancing cells.</li>
<li>The speaker then explains how dancing cells can be used to solve exact covering problems more efficiently.</li>
<li>Dancing cells use an array with three components (item, color, Lo) and a set for each item.</li>
<li>The data structure allows quick navigation and elimination of options as the problem is solved.</li>
<li>The speaker provides a detailed example of how dancing cells can be used to solve the toy problem.</li>
<li>He demonstrates how decisions are made, sub-problems are created, and options are deleted.</li>
<li>The speaker discusses the advantages of using dancing cells to solve exact covering problems.</li>
<li>They allow for more efficient solving by eliminating branches that don't need to be explored.</li>
<li>Learning can also be employed to make the solver even faster.</li>
<li>The speaker mentions that he has benchmarked the performance of dancing cells against traditional methods and other solvers.</li>
<li>He notes that dancing cells outperform other methods in certain cases but may not always be the fastest option.</li>
<li>The speaker concludes by discussing the importance of understanding different solving strategies for exact covering problems.</li>
<li>He encourages architects and developers to explore various approaches, including using learning techniques, to find the most effective solution for their specific use case.</li>
