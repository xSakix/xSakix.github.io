<li>Ecosystem of libraries for various tasks.</li>
<li>Creating UI in Compose using a declarative approach with composable functions.</li>
<li>Demos showcasing basic button counter, performance optimization, text input, and microservice integration.</li>
<li>Composable functions allow efficient UI rendering by avoiding unnecessary recomposition.</li>
<li>View models separate state and event handlers from the UI.</li>
<li>State can be derived in composable functions using other states.</li>
<li>Private observable state can be modified within event handlers.</li>
<li>Composable UI can be used on Android, iOS, and desktop with minimal changes.</li>
<li>Multiplatform libraries handle networking, marshalling, and concurrency.</li>
<li>Co-routines manage jobs of work and cancel them when needed.</li>
<li>State management is done using a single state object for the UI.</li>
<li>Compos offers incremental learning, supports multiple platforms, and leverages Kotlin ecosystem.</li>
<li>Allows developers to choose their approach based on specific needs.</li>
<li>Offers concurrency via co-routines, making it easier to handle user interface events.</li>

<li>Reflex is an FP library with Dom framework, Platform, and Obelis.</li>
<li>Functional Programming (FP) focuses on dynamic values based on events.</li>
<li>Dynamic values change over time in response to events.</li>
<li>Reducer functions handle event and state for new states.</li>
<li>Reflex uses fold D to manage dynamic values.</li>
<li>Event Rider is an analog of dispatchers, allowing reusable widgets.</li>
<li>Widgets are components with specific constraints, building DOM elements and emitting events.</li>
<li>Reflex centralizes state and simplifies UI development.</li>
<li>Monad Reader adds time-varying values to context for complex UI behavior.</li>
<li>Reflex focuses on composable and reusable widgets without a magic store like Redux or Relay.</li>
<li>Conduit app demonstrates real-world usage of Reflex.</li>
<li>A functioning Nyx Obelisk environment is required for the workshop.</li>
<li>Virtual Box setup instructions are provided in the program.</li>

<li>Calling functions across languages can be achieved using different methods, such as HTTP requests and responses or direct communication between processes.</li>
<li>Optimizing the process involves removing HTTP boilerplate, focusing on data transfer, and using localhost and binary encoding instead of JSON.</li>
<li>Inter-process communication (IPC) like Unix sockets can further reduce overhead.</li>
<li>The goal is to call a Ruby function from JavaScript within a single process with minimal overhead.</li>

<li>The problem is finding equivalent sub-expressions in a program and making small rewrites.</li>
<li>Hashconzing can be used for incremental analysis but doesn't work well with lambdas due to false positives and negatives.</li>
<li>Using Divine notation removes names from lambdas, but introduces new issues: overheads in the compiler and both false positives and negatives.</li>
<li>The speaker didn't find a perfect solution for this problem during their talk.</li>
<li>Dubai notation has issues with false positives and negatives.</li>
<li>E-summary is a solution to find Alpha equivalent subexpressions.</li>
<li>E-summary consists of structure and free variable map.</li>
<li>Hash codes are extracted from e-summaries for efficient comparison.</li>
<li>Collisions can occur, but should be infrequent.</li>
<li>The approach focuses on Isamu first, then extracts hash codes and uses a table to save nodes with the same hash code.</li>
<li>Introducing e-summaries: A pair of a structure and a free variable map.</li>
<li>Structure: Describes the shape of an expression without mentioning identities or locations of variables.</li>
<li>Variable Map: Maps variables to their positions in the structure.</li>
<li>E-summary for single variable: Structure is svar, variable map maps variable to P here.</li>
<li>Lambdas: Recursively call summarize and extract structure and variable map from summary.</li>
<li>Application nodes: Use e-summaries of children expressions to create e-summary of application node.</li>
<li>No two position trees point to the same location.</li>
<li>E7 concept: Structure and free verbal map.</li>
<li>S-dam container (Repository) vs. Pository.</li>
<li>Summarize function: Takes an expression, delivers e-summary.</li>
<li>Hash summaries: Replace structures with structure hashes, positives with pository hashes for more efficient reconstruction.</li>
<li>Handling shadowing in e-summaries: No issues as they're anonymous and don't have names.</li>
<li>Next step: Discussing app nodes.</li>
<li>E summaries deal with shadowing by treating them as anonymous variables.</li>
<li>Hash summaries use structure hashes and pository hashes for more efficient reconstruction.</li>
<li>App nodes require attention to every element of both VAR Maps, leading to O(n^2) work in unbalanced trees.</li>
<li>Solution: Only adjust items in smaller map, recording depth and bigger map flag in structures.</li>
<li>This approach allows efficient rebuilding while maintaining perfect inversion.</li>
<li>Discussed the process of combining and splitting variable maps in a tree structure.</li>
<li>The complexity is O(n log n) due to work done on smaller trees.</li>
<li>Considered using hashes for variable maps, but deleting elements from them was problematic.</li>
<li>Introduced exclusive or (XOR) as a solution: hash of a variable map is the XOR of its key value pairs' hashes.</li>
<li>Deletion can be achieved by XORing the hash of the deleted element with the available map hash.</li>
<li>Synthetic benchmarks and real-world tests show that the proposed method outperforms other correct algorithms.</li>
<li>Synthetic test cases show balanced and unbalanced expressions.</li>

<li>Francesco and Robert, co-inventors of Erlang, discussed their experiences in building a programming language for telecom applications with concurrency, fault tolerance, and upgradability while running.</li>
<li>They demonstrated the concept using an electric train simulation at a conference, focusing on concurrency and processes.</li>
<li>Key ideas behind Erlang include concepts like concurrent systems, data isolation, and asynchronous communication.</li>
<li>Processes in Erlang are lightweight and efficient, allowing millions to interact simultaneously. When a process ends normally or crashes, the memory is freed immediately.</li>
<li>Communication between processes happens through messages with PIDs (process identifiers).</li>
<li>Asynchronous communication can lead to lost messages, so acknowledgments are used for confirmation. Failure detection is achieved by monitoring processes and linking them together.</li>
<li>Early mobile telephony systems had manual error handling, but Erlang's approach allows processes to monitor and link to each other, sending exit signals when a linked process crashes.</li>
<li>Trap exits enable processes to handle errors in a custom way, while supervisors monitor other processes and take appropriate actions (restart, terminate).</li>
<li>Concurrency models based on notion memory and message passing provide distribution, scalability, and reliability.</li>
<li>Three pioneers in concurrency research developed similar solutions for different problems: Carl Hewitt, Tony Hoare, and Joe Armstrong.</li>
<li>Concurrency is a property of the problem being solved while parallelism is a property of the underlying system. These models allow efficient distribution and scalability without worrying about hardware architecture.</li>
<li>Beam and JVM have differences in focus: Beam emphasizes scalability and resilience, while JVM focuses on speed/parallelism.</li>

<li>In the 1950s to 1990s, statically typed languages were more prevalent than dynamically typed ones.</li>
<li>The 1990s saw a boom in dynamic languages due to web growth and fast feedback loops.</li>
<li>Popular dynamic languages include JavaScript, Ruby, PHP, Python, and R.</li>
<li>Statically typed languages had advantages like runtime performance but were less relevant in the 1990s context.</li>
<li>Gradual typing systems emerged for dynamic languages, leading to more popularity for statically typed ones.</li>
<li>In the 1990s, dynamic languages dominated web use cases due to their fast feedback loops and concise syntax.</li>
<li>The LAMP stack became popular for early web needs.</li>
<li>Two dynamic languages made the top 20 most popular programming languages: PowerShell and CoffeeScript.</li>
<li>Statically typed languages like C#, ActionScript, Go, Rust, Dart, Kotlin, TypeScript, and Swift have gained popularity in recent years.</li>
<li>Modern JavaScript has less ceremony than older versions.</li>
<li>TypeScript adds minimal static typing without much ceremony.</li>
<li>The speaker's view of static typing has evolved over time.</li>
<li>Minimal ceremony in JavaScript leads to success.</li>
<li>Upgrading to Modern JavaScript involves minor changes.</li>
<li>Static typing in TypeScript adds minimal extra code compared to Java's static typing.</li>
<li>Advantages of Java implementation include better equals and hashcode implementations, early JSON validation, and useful Getters/Setters.</li>
<li>Rock programming language uses type inference for early JSON validation without explicit type annotations.</li>
<li>Concise code can be achieved with proper language design and features.</li>
<li>Null pointer exceptions are not innate to static typing; some languages have null-aware type checkers.</li>
<li>Elm and Haskell have sound type systems, leading to fewer runtime errors.</li>
<li>Error messages in modern languages are improving, becoming clearer and more helpful.</li>
<li>IDEs can be laggy but performance has improved with multi-core processors.</li>
<li>Static typing has improved over time, with better error messages and IDE performance.</li>
<li>Feedback loops have also become faster in statically typed languages like Haskell.</li>
<li>The main benefit of static typing for many people is the red squiggle (syntax errors) in their IDEs, which helps them catch issues earlier than runtime crashes.</li>
<li>Static typing has become more popular with languages like TypeScript and Elm, showing that it can be enjoyable to use.</li>
<li>In the past, static typing was seen as slow with feedback loops.</li>
<li>Modern languages have improved this by offering faster feedback and non-blocking errors.</li>
<li>Three hypothetical futures: 1) Dynamic typing returns, 2) Gradual typing becomes popular, or 3) Static typing without gradual typing grows.</li>
<li>The pendulum swinging back to dynamic typing is less likely as statically typed languages can offer the same benefits.</li>
<li>Future of static and dynamic typing will depend on how well they adapt to new technologies and user needs.</li>
<li>Gradual typing has become more popular by adding static type checking to existing dynamically typed ones.</li>
<li>ActionScript and Dart were the only gradually typed languages from the start, but Dart later switched to full static typing.</li>
<li>Static typing has a simpler design space compared to gradual typing, which needs to model all dynamic behavior.</li>
<li>Gradual typing introduces runtime overhead due to checking types at both compile time and runtime.</li>
<li>Historical evidence doesn't support the claim that gradually typed languages will become mainstream in the future.</li>
<li>Static typing has become more popular due to improvements in statically typed languages that adopt benefits of dynamically typed ones.</li>
<li>Gradual typing is not the best solution as it comes with unavoidable downsides, such as runtime overhead and complexity.</li>
<li>Rock language aims for simplicity, performance, and ease of use without sacrificing benefits of statically typed languages.</li>
<li>Prediction: Among the next five popular programming languages, most or all will be statically but not gradually typed.</li>

<li>Functional programming is a style that avoids mutation and side effects, focusing on immutability, pure functions, and functional languages.</li>
<li>Pure functional languages support only pure functions, which ensure predictable behavior and enable caching techniques like memoization.</li>
<li>Performance advantages of functional programming include caching, pre-computing, and parallelization; disadvantages include increased memory usage due to immutability and potential performance issues with recursion.</li>
<li>Functional languages focus on immutability, pure functions, and functional programming concepts.</li>
<li>Caching strategies include memoization, which is easier to implement with pure functions. Precomputing can be done at build time for known constants or function calls, reducing runtime costs.</li>
<li>Parallelization can speed up functional programs but requires thread safety inherent in pure functions.</li>
<li>Managed effects offer an alternative to side effects by creating tasks instead of immediately executing actions like promises; this approach improves performance and simplifies code.</li>
<li>Pure functional programming offers benefits for development, such as fewer flaky tests due to minimized effects, no need for mocking, and the ability to test effects through simulation.</li>
<li>Rearranging code in functional languages is possible without affecting the result. Global mutable variables create implicit dependencies and make debugging difficult; pure functions have explicit dependencies and are easier to debug.</li>
<li>Side effects introduce implicit dependencies, increasing search space for bugs. In pure functional programming, explicit dependencies make debugging simpler.</li>
<li>Functional programming offers benefits like caching, parallelization, testing, code revision, debugging, and ecosystem advantages. Pure functional languages provide a more reliable experience compared to imperative ones.</li>

<li>Assessing test suite quality involves various methods like TDD, peer review, and code coverage.</li>
<li>Code coverage is not always effective as it doesn't guarantee useful testing.</li>
<li>Richard Lipton introduced fault diagnosis in 1971 for finding bugs in tested code.</li>
<li>Mutation testing, developed in the '80s, gained popularity with Jesse in 2000 and is used for safety-critical projects and normal codes.</li>
<li>The process involves creating mutants, compiling code, running tests, and identifying which mutants are killed by the test suite.</li>
<li>Mutation testing offers a degree of confidence in the effectiveness of a test suite but isn't perfect.</li>
<li>Open source community introduced mutation testing; traditional methods were slow and impractical. PIT (Parallel Instruction Testing) tool improved efficiency.</li>
<li>Reduce test execution time by running tests in parallel, skipping compilation cycles, and optimizing test cases.</li>

<li>JVM performance talks focus on Java program execution and code optimization.</li>
<li>The JVM is an adaptive platform with three levels of compilation: interpretation, C1 (static compilation), and C2 (just-in-time compilation).</li>
<li>Call sites are crucial for method-level optimization in the JVM.</li>
<li>Virtual calls allow overriding methods in languages like Java while maintaining performance despite numerous method calls.</li>
<li>Java's method-based JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation focuses on improving methods.</li>
<li>Virtual calls in Java are efficient due to vtables, which store method signatures and locations.</li>
<li>Smalltalk used caches for performance improvement.</li>
<li>The JVM uses linked call sites for faster execution by checking assertions and jumping directly to the code.</li>
<li>Call sites can be monomorphic (direct link), biomorphic (conditional jump), or polymorphic (multiple direct links).</li>
<li>Optimizations like inlining code are possible based on these types of call sites.</li>
<li>JVM call sites can be monomorphic, biomorphic, or mega morphic.</li>
<li>Monomorphic call sites are direct links to code positions.</li>
<li>Biomorphic and mega morphic call sites use table lookups for dispatching.</li>
<li>Ahead of time compilation optimizes static code but is less useful for long-running processes.</li>
<li>Inlining code helps JIT compilers optimize further, making methods bigger targets.</li>
<li>Maintaining small and simple classes helps with optimization.</li>
<li>Double brace initialization can create new types, affecting call site morphism.</li>
<li>Inlining code is important for optimization.</li>
<li>Mega morphism can make inlining difficult, leading to slower programs.</li>
<li>Monomorphic methods are easier to optimize and faster.</li>
<li>JIT compilers use techniques like unrolling loops to improve performance.</li>
<li>Type systems help processors understand data better for efficient prefetching.</li>
<li>Branch prediction helps CPUs work more efficiently by speculating on code execution paths.</li>

<li>Cotton, a general purpose language, addresses modern programming challenges through its suspend functions for natural asynchronous coding.</li>
<li>Service-oriented architecture leads to complex business logic and cascading failures due to slow services; synchronous programming is one solution using threads and waiting for responses.</li>
<li>Various approaches like callbacks, futures/promises, and reactive programming are used for asynchronous programming. Cotton's suspend functions simplify this process without complex combinators.</li>
<li>Reactive programming can be hard to read due to code combinations; some languages propose a sink await paradigm based on futures (e.g., C# tasks or JavaScript promises).</li>
<li>Carbon Curtains use suspend functions for more natural programming without future combinators, and Spring 5.2 natively supports them. Adapters can help integrate with frameworks that don't directly support suspending functions.</li>
<li>Performance is crucial for server-side applications; callbacks are efficient low-level primitives. Suspending functions in Spring 5.2 make it easier to write asynchronous code.</li>
<li>If your framework doesn't support synchronous or asynchronous operations, use reactive or future builders with adapters. Curtain builder helps transform code with curtains into a synchronous type for other frameworks.</li>
<li>Suspending functions are more efficient than traditional approaches in terms of memory allocation and performance. Configuring service threads depends on the I/O framework used but is easier to scale with suspending functions.</li>
<li>If blocking occurs due to legacy code or third-party libraries, use a dispatcher thread pool to execute tasks asynchronously. Configure system efficiency by using context to avoid blocking main threads and create separate thread pools for different types of operations (CPU, I/O, etc.).</li>
<li>Curtains provide natural support for consolation, allowing cancellation of long-running tasks. They ensure safe execution, preventing leaks and resources from being left behind after failures. Enforcing curtain usage through types helps with documentation and better organization of code.</li>

<li>Typescript was released in 2012 as a tool for compiling code into JavaScript, aiming to improve the language rather than replace it.</li>
<li>CoffeeScript and Dart were other compile-to-JavaScript tools that didn't achieve the same level of success as Typescript due to various reasons.</li>
<li>Typescript has been more successful because it feels familiar to existing JavaScript developers while focusing on improving the language.</li>
<li>Both CoffeeScript and Dart faced challenges in gaining mass adoption among the JavaScript community, primarily due to unfamiliar code for developers.</li>
<li>NativeScript initially considered not using TypeScript but later embraced it as it made developers more productive.</li>
<li>Typescript's success can be attributed to its commitment to the JavaScript standard, familiarity for developers, and opt-in typing system.</li>
<li>The typescript compiler can infer types without explicit declarations, making it easier to learn and use.</li>
<li>Tooling support in editors like Visual Studio Code provides intelligent suggestions, autocomplete, and seamless integration with libraries and frameworks.</li>
<li>Types are available for popular libraries and frameworks through NPM packages, enhancing the development experience.</li>
<li>Flow is similar to Typescript but operates directly on JavaScript files, making it slightly slower.</li>
<li>Benefits of using Typescript include improved productivity for large teams, better code understanding, and easier collaboration with non-JavaScript developers.</li>
<li>Downsides of Typescript include configuration complexity and advanced features that may confuse some developers.</li>
<li>Organizations with diverse app developers may benefit from using TypeScript, as it can be useful for debugging and non-JavaScript developers can find comfort in using it for front-end work.</li>

<li>Paradigms can be applied across various domains like data analysis, machine learning, and natural language processing.</li>
<li>Shifting from one paradigm to another requires a community consensus on the new model's usefulness and ability to address anomalies.</li>
<li>Scientific paradigms and programming languages have evolved over time.</li>
<li>Imperative programming focuses on commands, state, and precise timing.</li>
<li>Object-oriented programming (OOP) introduced objects with their own state and interactions via messages.</li>
<li>Functional programming focuses on pure functions that return values without changing state or side effects.</li>
<li>Declarative programming is about describing the desired result instead of how to achieve it.</li>
<li>Domain-specific languages (DSLs) are specialized for specific tasks, making code more readable and maintainable.</li>
<li>Different paradigms can have similar concepts, making them less distinct than initially thought.</li>
<li>Declarative programming includes logic programming and object-oriented (OOP) &amp; functional programming.</li>
