<li>Event-driven architecture can help to decouple systems and make them more scalable</li>
<li>Asynchronous messaging is a common way to implement event-driven architectures, but it can also be done with synchronous HTTP requests</li>
<li>Testing asynchronous event-driven systems can be more difficult than testing synchronous systems, but it's possible to test individual components or services in isolation</li>
<li>When testing asynchronous systems, it's important to consider the order and timing of events, as well as how they affect the state of the system</li>
<li>Testing strategies for event-driven systems may include using mocks or stubs for dependencies, using message brokers that support test features, and using tools that can simulate message traffic.</li>

<li>Rebecca Parsons discussed the role of architects in communicating with stakeholders and decision-makers</li>
<li>Architects need to be able to explain technical concepts in terms that connect with business value</li>
<li>Architecture decisions should be made based on their impact on business requirements, not just technical considerations</li>
<li>It's important to communicate the consequences of making certain decisions, such as increased development time or reduced scalability</li>
<li>Architects should focus on building relationships and trust with stakeholders over time</li>
<li>Architects can use objective measures, such as risk assessments or cost-benefit analyses, to make their case for certain decisions</li>
<li>Communication is a critical skill for architects, and they need to learn how to convey technical concepts in plain language</li>
<li>It's important to be able to explain the "why" behind architecture decisions, not just the "how" or "what"</li>
<li>Architects should be proactive in identifying potential issues and bringing them up with stakeholders early on</li>
<li>Ultimately, architects need to be able to communicate effectively with decision-makers to ensure that their technical decisions align with business goals.</li>

<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of integrating code into a shared repository frequently, which helps in identifying integration issues early on.</li>
<li>Continuous Delivery (CD) is the ability to get changes of all types—including new features, configuration changes, bug fixes and experiments—into production or into the hands of users safely and quickly in a sustainable way.</li>
<li>The main difference between CI and CD is that CI focuses on integrating code while CD focuses on delivering it to the end-users.</li>
<li>Continuous Deployment (CD) is an automated process that pushes changes to production without human intervention.</li>
<li>Testing is crucial in both CI and CD as it helps in identifying issues early on and ensuring the quality of the software being delivered.</li>
<li>DevOps culture emphasizes collaboration between development and operations teams, breaking down silos, and sharing responsibilities for software delivery.</li>
<li>Shipping code frequently does not necessarily mean delivering value to users, and it's essential to focus on delivering value rather than just shipping code.</li>
<li>The main goal of CI/CD is to deliver high-quality software quickly and safely while maintaining a sustainable development process.</li>

<li>Microservices are a way of structuring an application as a collection of small autonomous services.</li>
<li>Each microservice:<ul>
<li>Is developed around a specific business capability.</li>
<li>Runs in its own process and communicates with other services using a lightweight mechanism, often an HTTP resource API.</li>
<li>Can be deployed independently.</li>
<li>Can be managed by different teams.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Advantages of microservices:<ul>
<li>Easier to understand and maintain.</li>
<li>Faster development cycles.</li>
<li>Better fault isolation.</li>
<li>Scalability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Disadvantages of microservices:<ul>
<li>Increased operational complexity.</li>
<li>Network latency.</li>
<li>Distributed transaction management.</li>
<li>Service coordination.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>The talk was about how architecture and agile can work together, and the role of an architect in an agile organization.</li>
<li>Agile is about bringing change, and architecture is there to bring options.</li>
<li>Architecture and agile go together because both are about bringing change.</li>
<li>There are different roles for an architect in an agile organization, such as a "change agent" or a "catalyst".</li>
<li>The traditional role of an architect may not be necessary in an agile organization, where change is constant.</li>
<li>Architects should focus on bringing options and facilitating change, rather than dictating solutions.</li>
<li>Architects should work closely with development teams to understand their needs and help them make decisions.</li>
<li>An architect's role may change over time as the organization evolves and adapts to new challenges.</li>
<li>It is important for an architect to have a deep understanding of the technology and business, and to be able to communicate effectively with different stakeholders.</li>

<li>Software architecture is the high-level design of a software system and it's important to consider it early in the development process</li>
<li>There are different architectural styles, such as monolithic and microservices. Each has its own trade-offs and should be chosen based on the specific needs of the project.</li>
<li>Modularity is key to good design, regardless of the architectural style. It allows for easier maintenance, testing, and scaling.</li>
<li>Understanding the dependencies between different parts of the system is crucial for making informed decisions about its architecture.</li>
<li>If you can't build monoliths properly, don't do microservices. Make sure to have a solid understanding of how to structure your code before moving on to more complex architectures.</li>

<li>Solaris Bank is a German bank that provides banking services through APIs.</li>
<li>They decided to migrate their monolithic system to an event-driven architecture using AWS Lambda and other managed services like DynamoDB, SNS, and SQS.</li>
<li>The migration was done in two phases: the first phase involved decoupling the monolith into microservices and integrating them with the new architecture, while the second phase involved migrating data from the old system to the new one.</li>
<li>They used a tool called AWS Serverless Application Repository (SAR) to package their Lambda functions and dependencies, making it easier to deploy and manage them.</li>
<li>They also used AWS App Mesh to manage service-to-service communication and AWS Glue for data integration.</li>
<li>The new architecture provided several benefits like better scalability, availability, and cost-efficiency compared to the old monolithic system.</li>
<li>They faced some challenges during the migration process, such as dealing with cold starts in Lambda functions, managing stateful services, and ensuring data consistency between microservices.</li>
<li>However, they managed to overcome these issues by using techniques like function warmup, implementing eventual consistency, and using distributed tracing tools like AWS X-Ray.</li>

<li>Continuous Architecture is a way to ensure that architecture decisions are aligned with business goals and can evolve over time.</li>
<li>The four essential activities of Continuous Architecture are focusing on quality attributes, driving and revisiting architecture decisions, knowing your technical debt, and implementing feedback loops.</li>
<li>Quality attributes are the four fundamental aspects of a system: performance, security, scalability, and maintainability.</li>
<li>Architecture decisions should be based on these quality attributes, and should be revisited regularly to ensure they still meet the needs of the business.</li>
<li>Technical debt is the cost of making suboptimal architecture decisions, and it's important to be aware of it and address it as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Feedback loops are essential for learning from mistakes and improving decision-making in the future. They can be implemented through various mechanisms such as code reviews, automated testing, and monitoring.</li>
<li>The Continuous Architecture approach emphasizes collaboration between stakeholders, including business leaders, developers, and operations teams, to ensure that architecture decisions align with business goals and are executed effectively.</li>

<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>The speaker, John Allspaw, is discussing his experiences and insights on incident management and resilience engineering.</li>
<li>Resilience engineering focuses on understanding how systems fail and how to make them more robust.</li>
<li>It's important to recognize that failure is a natural part of any system, and it's impossible to prevent all failures.</li>
<li>The goal should be to minimize the impact of failures when they do occur.</li>
<li>To do this, it's essential to have a deep understanding of how the system works, including its weak points and vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>It's also important to have a culture of learning and improvement, where incidents are seen as opportunities to learn and improve, rather than as failures to be punished.</li>
<li>The speaker emphasizes the importance of communication and collaboration in incident management, both within teams and between different organizations.</li>
<li>He also discusses the challenges of managing complex systems, where there are many interdependencies and feedback loops, and where small changes can have large unintended consequences.</li>
<li>The speaker stresses the need for humility and caution when making changes to complex systems, as even seemingly minor adjustments can have significant impacts.</li>
<li>He also highlights the value of automation and monitoring in incident management, but cautions against relying too heavily on technology and neglecting the human element.</li>
<li>Finally, the speaker emphasizes the importance of continual learning and improvement in resilience engineering, and encourages organizations to adopt a proactive approach to managing incidents and failures.</li>

<p>Summary of Transcript:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relational databases have been the standard for many years, but they are not always the best choice for storing hierarchical data structures.</li>
<li>Hierarchical data models can be more efficient and performant than relational models in certain scenarios.</li>
<li>There are various ways to store hierarchical data, such as nested sets, materialized paths, closure tables, and recursive trees.</li>
<li>Nested sets are a popular way to represent hierarchical data, but they have some limitations and can be slow for certain operations.</li>
<li>Materialized paths are another method that is more efficient for reading, but not writing.</li>
<li>Closure tables store the relationships between nodes in a separate table, which makes it easy to query, but can be slow when there are many relationships.</li>
<li>Recursive trees use a recursive function to traverse the tree and can be slower than other methods, but they allow for more flexibility in how the tree is stored.</li>
<li>There are some libraries available that help with storing hierarchical data, such as <code>acts_as_tree</code> and <code>ancestry</code>.</li>
<li>When choosing a method to store hierarchical data, consider the size of the dataset, the frequency of reads and writes, and the complexity of the queries.</li>
<li>It's important to keep performance in mind when working with large datasets, especially for write-heavy applications.</li>
<li>The speaker encourages developers to experiment with different methods and choose the one that fits their specific use case best.</li>

 - Recipes are a good starting point, especially for beginners
- Following a recipe closely can be helpful at the start of a project
- However, it's important not to be dogmatic and continue to follow a recipe exactly in the long run
- Contexts are the most valuable contribution of recipes, they provide a boundary within which you can make different decisions from others
- Use contexts to help guide your decision making process.

## What Are Reactive Systems? • Dave Farley • GOTO 2021

URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ysn6eInApYM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ysn6eInApYM)

 * Messaging allows for location transparency and clustering
* The code doesn't need to change in any way to make clustering work
* The infrastructure can handle the load balancing and allocation
* Messaging separates accidental complexity (running stuff on a computer) from essential complexity (domain logic or function)
* This approach allows for focus on the problem being solved rather than the technical details
* Relational databases work in a similar way internally
* The core of the exchange built this way could process 6.5 million trades per second on a single thread


## Idiomatic RabbitMQ • Gavin M. Roy • RabbitMQ Summit

URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNbdgWe5Tbs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNbdgWe5Tbs)

 * RabbitMQ is a message broker that can handle high volumes of messages and provide reliability, scalability, and flexibility.
* It has features such as message durability, delivery acknowledgements, publisher confirms, and message priority.
* When using RabbitMQ, it's important to think about the design of your messaging system and how messages are routed and consumed.
* Consider using a fanout exchange for simplicity, direct exchanges for fine-grained control, or topic exchanges for more complex routing scenarios.
* It's also crucial to consider message serialization and deserialization formats, as well as error handling and retry mechanisms.
* When designing your messaging system, keep in mind the principles of loose coupling, high cohesion, and failure isolation.
* Using RabbitMQ can provide benefits such as improved system resilience, scalability, and maintainability, but it also requires careful planning and design.

 * Documentation is essential for software development, but many teams have not yet reached this point.
* Younger or less mature engineering teams may avoid documentation, but they often realize its importance in two to three years.
* Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are becoming more popular, as they allow capturing and documenting key decisions made during the development process.
* Recording the rationale behind these decisions can prove valuable in the future.
* While the concept of capturing and checking decisions into code is not new, only a few teams practice it. The growing popularity of ADRs shows that this trend is changing.

<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Orchestration and choreography are two different communication styles used in microservices architecture.</li>
<li>Orchestration is command-driven, centralized, and has a unidirectional flow of control. Choreography is event-driven, decoupled, and has a bidirectional flow of control.</li>
<li>Both orchestration and choreography have their own advantages and disadvantages. Orchestration provides better observability and control, while choreography promotes loose coupling and autonomy.</li>
<li>It's important to balance both styles in a microservices architecture based on the use case and requirements.</li>
<li>The direction of dependency and responsibility should be considered when deciding between orchestration and choreography for a specific service.</li>
<li>Orchestration is not necessarily centralized, and choreography is not always decoupled. It depends on the implementation and design.</li>
</ul>
<p>Q&amp;A:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous communication?<ul>
<li>Synchronous communication waits for a response before continuing, while asynchronous communication does not.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can you have orchestration in an event-driven architecture?<ul>
<li>Yes, it's possible to use command-driven orchestration in an event-driven architecture by having a centralized component that sends commands to other services.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How do you ensure consistency between microservices?<ul>
<li>Consistency can be ensured using various techniques such as eventual consistency, transactions, and event sourcing. It depends on the use case and requirements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What are some tools for implementing orchestration and choreography?<ul>
<li>Tools for orchestration include Kubernetes, AWS Step Functions, and Azure Logic Apps. Tools for choreography include Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, and AWS EventBridge.</li>

<p>Here are the five things every developer should know about software architecture, as presented by Kevlin Henney:</p>
<ul>
<li>Architecture is a significant decision that is hard to change. It's not just code or infrastructure, but encompasses both and how they interact.</li>
<li>Good architecture enables change, rather than dictating it. It provides choices, rather than limiting them.</li>
<li>The design of software and the organization of teams are intimately related. Architecture should support communication and collaboration between teams.</li>
<li>Microservices are not a silver bullet or a default choice. They should be used only when they provide a clear advantage over other architectural styles.</li>
<li>When considering microservices, think about the problem you're trying to solve, rather than starting from scratch with a view to rewrite your monolith as a collection of microservices. You may end up with a distributed monolith if you're not careful.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The talk discussed the importance of architecture in software development</li>
<li>Architecture is defined as the stuff that's hard to change, and it's important to be explicit about it</li>
<li>The speaker advised against creating bottlenecks or roadblocks and being someone who everyone else has to wait on</li>
<li>Motivation comes from cross-functional teams that can deliver something end-to-end</li>
<li>Decisions should be made at the level closest to the actual problem, where the work happens</li>
<li>The speaker encouraged having few rules, making it easier for people to adhere to them.</li>

<ul>
<li>The speaker discussed the importance of understanding and testing software configurations.</li>
<li>Many systems have latent configuration errors due to lack of checking and testing.</li>
<li>Configuration is often seen as a detail, but it can be critical to the functioning of the software.</li>
<li>The speaker quoted Robert Persig's observation that even seemingly unimportant parts, like a screw on a motorcycle, can be vital to the overall function of the system.</li>
<li>The speaker encouraged the audience to expand their knowledge of software configurations and to test them thoroughly.</li>

<ul>
<li>Workflows are a way to manage the state of long-running processes</li>
<li>Visual processes, such as BPMN, make it easier to discuss and change workflows</li>
<li>Event driven choreography is useful but not a magic cure-all, and orchestration is still necessary at certain points in an architecture</li>
<li>Decentralized and asynchronous event driven choreography can be used</li>
<li>Q&amp;A:<ul>
<li>How do you handle errors in workflows?<ul>
<li>There are several ways to handle errors in workflows, such as using catch events or error boundaries. It depends on the specific use case.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can you use microservices with a monolithic workflow engine?<ul>
<li>Yes, it is possible to use microservices with a monolithic workflow engine, but it may not be the best approach. It is better to have a decentralized architecture where each service has its own state management and workflow capabilities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How do you handle retries in workflows?<ul>
<li>Retries can be handled using compensation mechanisms or by configuring the workflow engine to automatically retry failed tasks. It depends on the specific use case.</li>

<ul>
<li>Service meshes are a way to add functionality like traffic management, security, and observability to distributed applications.</li>
<li>The most popular service mesh implementations include Istio, Linkerd, and Consul Connect.</li>
<li>Service meshes can be installed as sidecars alongside application containers in a Kubernetes cluster or using a data plane proxy such as Envoy.</li>
<li>Service meshes provide features like traffic management (route requests to specific versions of services), security (mutual TLS authentication, authorization policies), and observability (tracing, logging, metrics).</li>
<li>It is important to consider the trade-offs when deciding whether to use a service mesh, such as added complexity and potential performance overhead.</li>
<li>The hosts recommended some resources for learning more about service meshes, including the "Service Mesh Patterns" book and the "Getting Started with Service Mesh on Kubernetes" guide. They also suggested trying out examples of applications using service meshes, such as Istio and Linkerd.</li>

<ul>
<li>Container security is becoming increasingly important as containers are being used more widely in production environments.</li>
<li>Containers can introduce new attack surfaces, such as image vulnerabilities, container breakouts, and privilege escalation.</li>
<li>To secure containers, it's essential to have a comprehensive security strategy that includes image scanning, runtime protection, network segmentation, access control, and monitoring.</li>
<li>Image scanning can help identify known vulnerabilities, configuration errors, and malware in container images before they are deployed in production.</li>
<li>Runtime protection can help detect and prevent suspicious activities in running containers, such as unauthorized access, process injection, and network communication.</li>
<li>Network segmentation can limit the attack surface by isolating containers in different networks or subnets.</li>
<li>Access control can restrict who can access and manage containers, images, and other container resources.</li>
<li>Monitoring can help detect and respond to security incidents by providing real-time visibility into container activities, such as CPU usage, memory consumption, network traffic, and process behavior.</li>
<li>Some popular container security tools include Clair, Trivy, Aqua Security, Twistlock, Anchore Engine, and Falco.</li>
<li>Best practices for container security include keeping containers up-to-date, minimizing image sizes, using multi-stage builds, configuring resource limits, disabling unnecessary services, and monitoring container activities.</li>
<li>Resources for learning more about container security include the CNCF Container Security Special Interest Group, the Open Container Initiative (OCI), and the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Container Host Security Guide.</li>

<ul>
<li>The talk was about using behavioral code analysis to prioritize technical depth when working on software design.</li>
<li>Behavioral code analysis is a way of analyzing the structure and behavior of code to understand how it changes over time.</li>
<li>Prioritizing technical depth means focusing on making the most important parts of the system easier to change, rather than trying to make every part of the system perfect.</li>
<li>Locality of change is an enabler for scaling up systems because it allows teams to work on different parts of the system independently without affecting each other.</li>
<li>Behavioral code analysis and these techniques for prioritizing technical depth have a place in software development because they give insights that cannot be obtained from the code alone.</li>
<li>The main use case for this analysis is that they help focus expertise and attention to the parts of the system that are likely to change the most.</li>

<li>The speaker is discussing their experiences with technical debt and how to manage it effectively.</li>
<li>They define technical debt as the difference between what was planned and what was actually built.</li>
<li>Technical debt can be beneficial in some cases, such as when it allows for faster delivery of a product. However, it can also become a hindrance if not managed properly.</li>
<li>The speaker suggests using the "London style" TDG (Test-Driven Gardening) approach to manage technical debt. This involves test-driving the code and continuously refactoring it to keep it clean and maintainable.</li>
<li>They also recommend using tools like SonarQube to monitor the health of the codebase and identify areas that need improvement.</li>
<li>The speaker shares their experiences pairing with another developer and experimenting with different TDD styles, such as the "elastic" style and the "classic" style.</li>
<li>They emphasize the importance of continuous learning and improving one's skills to stay up-to-date with the latest tools and techniques in software development.</li>

<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spring Boot is a popular framework for building web applications in Java.</li>
<li>The presenter discussed some of the problems with using magic strings and annotations in Spring Boot, such as difficulty in understanding code and refactoring.</li>
<li>He suggested using Kotlin instead of Java to take advantage of its type safety and null safety features, which can help eliminate some common errors.</li>
<li>The presenter then discussed how to remove magic from Spring Boot by gradually migrating from annotations to the functional programming style. This involves:<ul>
<li>Migrating routes from controller classes to route DSL files.</li>
<li>Replacing beans with a bean DSL.</li>
<li>Using the web MVC DSL instead of reactive programming.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The presenter also mentioned that Spring Boot is working on improving its functional programming support in future releases.</li>

<li>Blockchain technology allows for decentralized and distributed databases that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way.</li>
<li>Bitcoin is an example of a popular blockchain technology that enables the transfer of value without needing a trusted third party, like a bank or government.</li>
<li>Transactions are grouped into blocks and added to the blockchain through a process called mining, which involves solving complex mathematical problems.</li>
<li>The decentralized nature of blockchain technology means that it is not controlled by any single entity, making it more secure and resistant to tampering.</li>
<li>Blockchain technology has potential applications beyond cryptocurrency, such as supply chain management, voting systems, and digital identities.</li>
<li>In the context of online payments, blockchain technology can provide faster and cheaper transactions compared to traditional methods like credit cards or PayPal.</li>
<li>The time it takes for a transaction to be confirmed on the Bitcoin network is around 10 minutes, but this can vary depending on the network's congestion.</li>
<li>In the case of online payments with blockchain technology, the confirmation of the transaction is crucial to ensure that the payment has been processed correctly and cannot be reversed.</li>
<li>It is possible to use other blockchain networks that offer faster confirmation times, such as Ethereum or Ripple. However, they may have different trade-offs in terms of cost, security, and adoption.</li>
<li>In summary, while there are some technical considerations when it comes to using blockchain technology for online payments, the main advantage is that it allows for decentralized and secure transactions without needing a trusted third party.</li>

<li>Kubernetes is a container orchestration tool</li>
<li>Security in Kubernetes involves configuring permissions upfront and following the principle of least privilege</li>
<li>Users and groups are first-class things in a Linux system, but including eTI's they're expected to be defined somewhere else in Kubernetes</li>
<li>There are different ways that users can authenticate with Kubernetes, such as using a username and password or using a token</li>
<li>Once a user is authenticated, they need to have the correct permissions to perform certain actions on resources</li>
<li>These permissions are granted through RBAC rules, which specify who can do what on which resources</li>
<li>It's important to configure these permissions correctly, as giving too many permissions to a user or group can lead to security vulnerabilities</li>
<li>There are three different types of resources in Kubernetes: namespaces, clusters, and eTI's</li>
<li>Namespaces are virtual clusters that allow users to organize their resources</li>
<li>Clusters are the physical infrastructure that runs Kubernetes</li>
<li>eTI's are external resources that can be accessed through Kubernetes</li>
<li>There are also different types of permissions in Kubernetes: verbs, resources, and namespaces</li>
<li>Verbs are the actions that a user can perform on a resource, such as 'get' or 'delete'</li>
<li>Resources are the objects that a user can interact with, such as pods or services</li>
<li>Namespaces are the virtual clusters where resources are organized</li>
<li>eTI's can have their own set of permissions and resources</li>
<li>To specify RBAC rules, you can use YAML files or the kubectl command line tool</li>
<li>It's also possible to use third-party tools like Open Policy Agent to enforce RBAC rules</li>
<li>When configuring RBAC rules, it's important to consider the different types of users and their roles in Kubernetes</li>
<li>For example, a developer might need different permissions than an administrator</li>
<li>You can also specify RBAC rules based on the user or group that is requesting access</li>
<li>It's important to test RBAC rules thoroughly before deploying them in a production environment</li>
<li>Make sure that users and groups only have the necessary permissions, and that eTI's are properly secured</li>
<li>Finally, it's recommended to use a network policy tool like Calico or Kubernetes Network Policy to restrict traffic between pods and services. This can help prevent security vulnerabilities caused by lateral movement in your cluster.</li>

<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>The speaker talks about the microservices architecture they adopted at Atlassian.</li>
<li>They discuss how they use OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) to document their APIs and how they use a tool called Swagger Packet Validator to ensure that the documentation is up-to-date.</li>
<li>They also talk about how they handle legacy systems and ensure that new microservices can communicate with them without issues.</li>
<li>They used OpenAPI to define incoming and outgoing contracts for their services, which allowed them to split a monolithic application into smaller microservices while ensuring compatibility between them.</li>
<li>They recorded all possible requests to and from the legacy system, converted them into packed files using OpenAPI tools, and then used these contracts to check if the new providers were behaving as expected. This approach allowed them to ensure that the legacy system would continue to work as intended after they separated it into smaller components.</li>
<li>They emphasized the importance of testing their microservices thoroughly before deploying them, using a tool called Postman to test all possible request scenarios and ensuring compatibility with different clients.</li>

<ul>
<li>The speaker discussed seven quests that a company might face when trying to implement resilient software design.</li>
<li>The first quest is understanding the problem domain and modeling it correctly. This includes identifying the boundaries of the system, the entities within it, and their relationships.</li>
<li>The second quest is mastering functional design. The speaker noted that as a domain, software engineering is still quite bad at this, and distributed systems add an extra twist to the challenge.</li>
<li>The third quest is picking up distributed systems. This includes understanding concepts such as eventual consistency, sharding, and CAP theorem.</li>
<li>The fourth quest is learning how to deal with partial failure. The speaker noted that in a distributed system, it's not a question of if something will fail, but when and where.</li>
<li>The fifth quest is mastering observability. This includes logging, monitoring, and tracing, which are crucial for understanding what is happening within a complex system.</li>
<li>The sixth quest is learning how to deal with concurrency. The speaker noted that this is a hard problem, and it's made even harder in a distributed system where there are multiple processes running concurrently.</li>
<li>The seventh quest is learning how to deal with legacy systems. The speaker noted that many companies have legacy systems that they need to integrate with, and doing so can be challenging.</li>
<li>The speaker emphasized that resilient software design is not just about the technology, but also about the people and the processes. It requires a cultural shift towards a more empirical approach, where experiments are used to test assumptions and hypotheses.</li>

<li>Monolithic architecture is a single, self-contained application where the UI, business logic, and data access are combined into a single program.</li>
<li>Microservices architecture breaks down an application into smaller, independently deployable services that can communicate with each other using APIs.</li>
<li>Pros of monolithic architecture: simpler to develop and deploy, less operational overhead, better performance due to fewer network calls.</li>
<li>Cons of monolithic architecture: scalability issues, difficulty in maintaining large codebases, slow development cycles due to the need for frequent redeployments.</li>
<li>Pros of microservices architecture: easier to scale and maintain, independent deployment of services, faster development cycles due to modularity.</li>
<li>Cons of microservices architecture: operational complexity, network latency, service discovery, data consistency, and testing challenges.</li>
<li>Choosing between monolithic or microservices depends on the specific needs of the project and the team's expertise. It is not a one-size-fits-all decision.</li>
<li>When choosing microservices, it is essential to ensure that the services communicate with each other using APIs and that diagrams match the code.</li>
<li>Microservices architecture requires more operational overhead, such as service discovery and communication between services.</li>
<li>Monolithic architecture can be a good choice for small teams or projects with simple requirements.</li>
<li>It is possible to start with a monolithic architecture and transition to microservices later if needed.</li>

<li>The talk was about the concept of "technical debt" in software development and how to address it using a prioritization technique.</li>
<li>Technical debt is the difference between the current state of the codebase and the ideal state, taking into account factors like complexity, maintainability, and test coverage.</li>
<li>The technique presented consists of 3 steps: measure technical debt, prioritize it, and then address it through refactoring or rewriting.</li>
<li>To measure technical debt, the speaker suggested using a combination of metrics such as cyclomatic complexity, code duplication, and test coverage.</li>
<li>To prioritize technical debt, the speaker proposed using a scoring system based on factors like business value, risk, and effort required to address it.</li>
<li>The speaker also emphasized the importance of continuous improvement and regular code reviews to prevent technical debt from accumulating.</li>

<li>Service-oriented architecture is an approach to software design that emphasizes the use of small, loosely coupled services to build complex systems.</li>
<li>Services are independent components that communicate with each other using well-defined interfaces and protocols.</li>
<li>The main benefits of service-oriented architecture include flexibility, scalability, and maintainability.</li>
<li>To successfully implement a service-oriented architecture, it is important to carefully design the services and their interfaces, as well as to choose an appropriate communication protocol.</li>
<li>Microservices are a type of service-oriented architecture that emphasizes even greater independence and simplicity of the individual services.</li>
<li>Service meshes are a way to manage the communication between microservices in a distributed system.</li>
<li>When designing a service-oriented architecture, it is important to consider aspects such as data consistency, security, and monitoring.</li>
<li>It is also important to keep in mind that service-oriented architecture is not always the best choice for every project, and that other approaches such as monolithic architectures may be more appropriate in certain cases.</li>
<li>The speaker is the founder of a consulting company that specializes in service-oriented architecture and microservices.</li>

<li>Security engineering is important for software developers, but there is often a disconnect between the security community and software development teams.</li>
<li>There is a lack of intersection between the two communities, with few software developers attending security conferences and vice versa.</li>
<li>The security community needs to do a better job of speaking the language of software developers and helping them prioritize security measures.</li>
<li>Hacking can happen to anyone, as demonstrated by the hacking of hacking team, a company that produces hacking technology.</li>
<li>It is important for software developers to take security measures seriously and apply best practices to their work.</li>

<li>Continuous architecture is a set of principles and tools that can help architects make their work more relevant and practical.</li>
<li>It involves breaking down silos, collaborating with developers and other teams, and continuously delivering value to the organization.</li>
<li>The principles of continuous architecture include:<ol>
<li>Embrace Change</li>
<li>Deliver Value Continuously</li>
<li>Make Architecture Everyone's Job</li>
<li>Practice Continuous Discovery</li>
<li>Use Appropriate Tools and Techniques</li>
<li>Organize Around Capabilities</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The continuous architecture mindset involves making architecture real and relevant, rather than something that sits on the side and is in constant conflict with other teams or the organization.</li>

<li>Synchronous and asynchronous communication have different trade-offs.</li>
<li>Synchronous communication is simpler and easier to reason about, but can lead to performance issues if not managed carefully.</li>
<li>Asynchronous communication can be more complex and harder to reason about, but can provide better performance and scalability.</li>
<li>When designing a system, it's important to consider the needs of the application and choose the appropriate communication style accordingly.</li>
<li>It's possible to mix synchronous and asynchronous communication in a single system, but care must be taken to ensure that they are properly isolated and managed.</li>
<li>A gateway service can be used to manage synchronous communication between services in an otherwise asynchronous system.</li>
<li>When using a database commit as a synchronous action, it's important to limit the amount of data being committed to avoid performance issues.</li>
<li>Agent Lee is a fundamental communication protocol that can be built upon to create other communication styles.</li>

<ul>
<li>Mobile devices, drones, and IoT devices have limited network connectivity, which can lead to high latency when trying to access data from a centralized server.</li>
<li>To address this issue, it's important to bring the data and computation together on the device itself, a concept known as endpoint computing or client cloud computing.</li>
<li>This approach can help reduce latency and improve the user experience by allowing devices to process and display information more quickly.</li>
<li>One example of endpoint computing is using mobile devices to perform tasks that would normally be done on a desktop computer, such as video editing or data analysis.</li>
<li>Another example is using drones to process sensor data in real-time, rather than sending it back to a central server for processing.</li>
<li>Endpoint computing can also help reduce the amount of data that needs to be transmitted over a network, which can save bandwidth and improve overall performance.</li>
<li>As mobile devices and IoT devices become more powerful, it's likely that we will see more applications of endpoint computing in the future.</li>

<li>Microservices is an architectural style that emphasizes small, loosely coupled services.</li>
<li>Continuous delivery is important for microservices because it enables quick and easy deployment and updating of individual services.</li>
<li>The book "Building Microservices" started out as a book about continuous delivery.</li>
<li>Microservices are the first major architectural paradigm to come along since continuous delivery became popular.</li>
<li>Operations departments will not like it if you implement microservices without involving them, because their processes for monitoring and error recovery will be different.</li>

<li>Software quality attributes are non-functional requirements that affect how a system operates.</li>
<li>Examples of software quality attributes include performance, security, usability, and maintainability.</li>
<li>Different stakeholders have different priorities when it comes to software quality attributes. For example, developers may be more concerned with maintainability, while users may be more interested in usability.</li>
<li>Software architects play a key role in ensuring that software quality attributes are considered and addressed in the design and development of a system.</li>
<li>A good starting point for improving software quality in an organization is to have software architects act as champions for software quality attributes. By focusing on these attributes, other aspects of the system such as features will take care of themselves.</li>

<li>Security is about trade-offs and making informed decisions</li>
<li>10 principles of security:<ul>
<li>Good security requires good design.</li>
<li>It's impossible to make anything foolproof because fools are so ingenious.</li>
<li>Treat people as a resource to be developed not a problem to be solved.</li>
<li>The difficulty of doing something is inversely proportional to how often it is done.</li>
<li>If you don't actively manage security, it will managedly get worse.</li>
<li>Security is not a product, but a process.</li>
<li>Complexity is the enemy of security.</li>
<li>Security is a non-competitive advantage.</li>
<li>There's no point in having security unless people use it.</li>
<li>The most secure system is one that is turned off and disconnected.</li>

<li>Starts by drawing diagrams to decompose problems</li>
<li>Uses UML notation for clarity and consistency, but not necessary</li>
<li>Diagramming helps clarify responsibilities and interactions between components</li>
<li>Helps identify high-level components in a system</li>
<li>Can use TDD or other testing strategies once components are identified</li>
<li>Diagrams serve as starting point for further development and evolution of the system</li>
<li>Encourages thinking about the system in terms of components and their relationships, which is useful for microservices architecture</li>
