<p>URL: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCCjZe0y4Qc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCCjZe0y4Qc</a></p>
<ul>
<li>The speaker, Harvan Husselt, is a research scientist at DeepMind in London, teaching a course on reinforcement learning at UCL.</li>
<li>He explains that the course is being delivered online due to the pandemic situation and goes into depth about reinforcement learning.</li>
<li>Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with its environment to maximize reward.</li>
<li>It's related to artificial intelligence, which automates mental solutions, starting from the industrial revolution and continuing with the digital revolution.</li>
<li>The main goal in reinforcement learning is to find a policy that maximizes cumulative reward.</li>
<li>The speaker recommends the book "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto for further reading.</li>
<li>The course covers different concepts and algorithms, with lectures available online on UCL's Moodle platform.</li>
<li>Students can ask questions in the forum for interaction and collaboration.</li>
<li>The speaker discusses the difference between active and passive learning and the importance of specifying a clear goal and reward function.</li>
<li>He mentions various examples of reinforcement learning applications, including flying helicopters, managing investment portfolios, controlling power stations, making robots walk, and playing video games.</li>
<li>The speaker emphasizes the importance of adaptive algorithms that can learn online and generalize to new situations.</li>
<li>Reinforcement learning is a science framework for making decisions based on interaction, with reinforcement planning being a specific algorithm.</li>
<li>The speaker mentions that reinforcement learning has synergy with deep learning and neural networks.</li>
<li>He provides an example of an Atari game called Beam Rider to illustrate the concepts.</li>
<li>The speaker discusses the concept of Markov property and its use in formulating reinforcement problems. * The case observation in reinforcement learning can be Markovian, meaning the probability of the next state depends only on the current state and action, not the entire history.</li>
<li>Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a useful mathematical framework for formulating and solving decision problems with the Markov property.</li>
<li>A Markovian state might not equal the full environment state, as some information might be thrown away due to the Markov property.</li>
<li>The observation might not be Markovian if it contains uninformative data or depends on past observations.</li>
<li>Partial Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) is an extension of MDP that deals with environments where the agent cannot observe the full state, and instead observes only a part of it.</li>
<li>The update function in reinforcement learning can depend on the observation stream and the agent's actions, as well as the current state.</li>
<li>A suitable state representation is important for dealing with partial observability, and using observation might be enough or might require full history depending on the problem size.</li>
<li>The value function defines the optimal policy, which picks the action that maximizes the expected reward given the current state and policy.</li>
<li>Planning involves computing the optimal policy given a model of the environment, which can be done in a model-free or model-based way.</li>
<li>Prediction and control are related problems in reinforcement learning, with prediction focusing on estimating future rewards and control optimizing policies to find the best actions.</li>
<li>Deep learning is a popular tool for learning functions in reinforcement learning, but it can violate assumptions such as stationarity and supervision.</li>
<li>The Atari game example shows how an agent learns a value function from pixel observations and joystick inputs, and uses this information to select actions based on the current state and policy. * The speaker discusses a mean value state and a prime value state in a dynamic world</li>
<li>Discount factor is used to see desirable states, with state b being somewhat desirable but the bottom left corner being quite undesirable</li>
<li>Optimal policy involves not bumping the wall anymore and getting the best possible state through transitions</li>
<li>The speaker mentions the optimal value function problem and the optimal policy, which are positive and result in no wall bumping</li>
<li>There is a figure (c) showing the optimal policy and how to move between states</li>
<li>The speaker discusses going around state b and the potential for getting stuck in a loop</li>
<li>Learning planning algorithm is discussed as a way to find the optimal solution without bumping the wall</li>
<li>The lecture touched upon various concepts like Q-learning, deep Q network (DQN), and policy gradient method</li>
<li>Deep reinforcement learning with a neural network was mentioned</li>
<li>The speaker mentions exploration and the concept of a bandit problem in the next lecture</li>
<li>A simple example of a reinforcement learning problem involving controlling a body part to move in a certain direction is given.</li>

<ul>
<li>Adolf Hussels discussing exploration and exploitation in reinforcement learning</li>
<li>Recommend reading chapter 2 of Sutton and Barto's "Reinforcement Learning" book for background</li>
<li>Topic is bandit algorithms, specifically the UCB algorithm</li>
<li>Previous lecture discussed RL and the interaction loop between agent and environment</li>
<li>Agent interacts with environment, which can change based on its actions and observations</li>
<li>Reward function defines agent's goal, which it tries to optimize by selecting actions</li>
<li>Exploration is trying new actions to gather information, while exploitation is maximizing performance based on current knowledge</li>
<li>Multiarmed bandit problem: set of actions with unknown rewards, need to determine optimal one</li>
<li>Greedy policy: always select action with highest estimated value</li>
<li>Epsilon-greedy algorithm: explore by randomly selecting other actions with probability epsilon</li>
<li>UCB (Upper Confidence Bound) algorithm: explores and exploits by balancing exploration and exploitation using confidence intervals</li>
<li>Gradient bandit algorithms: update policy parameters using gradient ascent to optimize expected reward</li>
<li>Softmax policy: select action based on probabilities derived from preferences</li>
<li>Stochastic gradient descent (SGD): optimization algorithm for finding minimum of a function, used in machine learning and deep learning.</li>
<li>The speaker mentions the Reinforce algorithm, which is an early reinforce learning algorithm proposed by Williams and Peng in 1992. It's an on-policy algorithm that uses temporal difference methods to learn Q-values and policy parameters using stochastic gradient ascent. It also introduces the idea of eligibility traces to efficiently estimate gradients.</li>
<li>The speaker mentions the concept of exploration vs exploitation tradeoff, where exploration involves trying new actions to gather information and exploitation involves taking actions based on current knowledge to maximize reward. In the context of multi-armed bandits, this means balancing between trying out new arms (exploration) and pulling the arm with the highest estimated reward (exploitation).</li>
<li>The UCB algorithm is a popular approach for solving the exploration-exploitation dilemma in multi-armed bandit problems. It uses an upper confidence bound to balance exploration and exploitation by calculating an exploration bonus term based on the uncertainty of the estimates. This bonus term encourages the algorithm to explore actions with higher uncertainty, while still exploiting the ones with known high rewards.</li>
<li>The speaker mentions that in a multi-armed bandit setting, there is no explicit environment state to observe, only rewards. Therefore, the agent needs to learn the distribution of rewards for each action based on past observations and use this information to make decisions.</li>
<li>The speaker also mentions that in some cases, it might be more efficient to model the environment as a single state, even if it's complicated, rather than trying to model every possible state. This simplifies the problem and makes it easier to reason about.</li>
<li>The speaker briefly touches on the concept of regret, which is the difference between the maximum expected reward that could have been obtained and the actual reward obtained by an algorithm. Minimizing regret is a common goal in reinforce learning and multi-armed bandit problems.</li>
<li>The speaker mentions that the UCB algorithm can be used to minimize regret by balancing exploration and exploitation, but other algorithms like Thompson Sampling and Upper Confidence Bound 1 (UCB1) have also been proposed for this purpose.</li>
<li>The speaker briefly discusses the concept of epsilon-greedy policy, which is a simple exploration strategy that selects an action with high probability based on current estimates, but with a small probability explores randomly. This strategy balances exploration and exploitation by allowing the agent to explore new actions while still exploiting known good ones.</li>
<li>The speaker mentions that in some cases, it might be more efficient to learn the policy directly instead of learning the value function first. This is known as policy gradient methods or policy optimization, where the policy parameters are updated directly using gradient ascent.</li>
<li>The speaker briefly discusses the concept of softmax policy, which is a probability distribution over actions that can be used to make decisions based on preferences or utilities assigned to each action. Softmax policies are commonly used in reinforce learning and deep reinforce learning.</li>
<li>The speaker mentions that in some cases, it might be more efficient to use a constant step size for gradient descent instead of adaptive step sizes. This can lead to tracking behavior, where the algorithm converges to a local optimum faster but might not find the global optimum if the environment is nonstationary.</li>
<li>The speaker mentions that in some cases, it might be more efficient to learn the value function directly using methods like Q-learning or SARSA instead of learning the policy directly. This can lead to better performance and easier convergence in certain environments.</li>
<li>The * The speaker discusses the concept of preference action and how it relates to reward in reinforcement learning.</li>
<li>Preference action with higher reward increases, while preference action with lower reward decreases.</li>
<li>Policy gradient algorithm is used to learn the policy through exploration, but it can get stuck at local optima and suffer from linear increasing regret over time.</li>
<li>The speaker mentions the importance of baseline in policy gradient algorithms and discusses the effect of different state values on variance reduction.</li>
<li>UCB (Upper Confidence Bound) algorithm is introduced as a way to balance exploration and exploitation by using an uncertainty bound.</li>
<li>Hoeffding's inequality is used to derive a bound for the estimate, which ensures that the probability of selecting a suboptimal action decreases over time.</li>
<li>The speaker mentions the importance of considering different cases in the derivation and simplifying notation for clarity.</li>
<li>The UCB algorithm picks the action with the highest estimated value plus uncertainty bound to ensure exploration while keeping the total regret logarithmic.</li>
<li>The speaker mentions that they will prove the logarithmic regret bound later in the lecture.</li>
<li>They also mention that there are other techniques that could be used instead of UCB, such as Thompson sampling and Bayesian optimization.</li>
<li>The speaker encourages the audience to refer to the paper for more details on the proof. * The speaker discusses probability theory and its application to selecting actions in a bounded one-step decision-making problem.</li>
<li>They mention using Huffman's inequality and the concept of regret.</li>
<li>The speaker suggests that the left-hand side of an equation should be random variable minus q, while the right-hand side should be expectation.</li>
<li>They propose the idea of a property larger than 2u to replace probability.</li>
<li>The speaker mentions the logarithmic case and the need for a precise proof.</li>
<li>They discuss the use of UCB (Upper Confidence Bound) and Thompson Sampling algorithms for bandit problems.</li>
<li>The speaker explains the concept of probability matching, which is different from UCB.</li>
<li>They describe the idea of optimism in the face of uncertainty and its relationship to UCB.</li>
<li>The speaker mentions the challenges of computing probabilities analytically and the use of POMDPs (Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes).</li>
<li>They discuss planning, explore-exploit tradeoff, and the idea of learning a Bayesian reward distribution.</li>
<li>The speaker mentions the difficulty of scaling reinforcement learning techniques for large problems.</li>
<li>The speaker provides an example problem and asks the audience to select the next action based on probability.</li>
<li>They compare the answers given by a greedy algorithm and UCB, and explain the difference between them.</li>
<li>The speaker assumes a beta distribution for the posterior distribution in Thompson Sampling and explains how it looks like the optimal action.</li>
<li>They discuss the similarities and differences between UCB and Thompson Sampling algorithms.</li>
<li>The speaker mentions that UCB does not always select the exact action, while Thompson Sampling might select it 25% of the time on average.</li>
<li>They suggest tweaking exploration parameters to change the behavior of UCB and Thompson Sampling.</li>

<li>Advantages of Monte Carlo methods over dynamic programming</li>
<li>Recap of upcoming lecture: policy learning and prediction tasks. * The speaker discusses the difference between Monte Carlo and Temporal Difference (TD) learning in the context of estimating state values.</li>
<li>TD learning updates value estimates based on the current state and the next state's estimated value, while Monte Carlo learning waits for the end of an episode to update the value estimate with the actual reward.</li>
<li>TD learning allows for online learning, as each transition is used to update the value estimate, whereas Monte Carlo learning requires the entire episode to be completed before updating.</li>
<li>TD learning can handle incomplete sequences and corrupted data better than Monte Carlo learning, but it may have a higher computational complexity due to the need to store and update separate tables for each state.</li>
<li>Monte Carlo learning has a lower memory requirement as it only needs to store the current estimate for each state, while TD learning requires storing the estimated value for each state-action pair.</li>
<li>TD learning can suffer from bias variance tradeoff, as the target value may be biased if the prediction is not accurate, leading to higher error.</li>
<li>Monte Carlo learning returns an unbiased estimate of the true value, but it may take longer to converge to the true value due to the need for more samples.</li>
<li>TD learning can handle partially observable environments by using an implicit target update and exploiting the Markov property, while Monte Carlo learning assumes a fully observable environment and does not make this assumption explicitly.</li>
<li>TD learning can propagate information slowly, leading to slow credit assignment, whereas Monte Carlo learning updates the previous state visited, allowing for faster propagation of information.</li>
<li>TD learning can look ahead multiple steps to update the value estimate, while Monte Carlo learning takes exactly one step at a time.</li>
<li>The speaker mentions that the choice between Monte Carlo and TD learning depends on the specific problem and the tradeoffs involved, such as computational complexity, memory requirement, and convergence rate. * The speaker discusses the relationship between Temporal Difference (TD) learning and Monte Carlo methods, focusing on the differences and similarities between one-step TD, n-step TD, and various other algorithms.</li>
<li>TD algorithms update value functions based on the temporal difference error, while Monte Carlo methods use the return from a single trajectory to estimate values.</li>
<li>One-step TD corresponds to TD(0) algorithm, which always chooses one time step for bootstrapping, while n-step TD uses n timestamps for bootstrapping.</li>
<li>The curves of TD and Monte Carlo methods look similar but are not exactly the same due to differences in how they handle instances and the number of steps taken.</li>
<li>The benefits of using mixed multistep returns include independence from temporal span prediction and computational efficiency.</li>
<li>Monte Carlo learning has issues with bias and variance, while TD learning has advantages in terms of information propagation and simplicity.</li>
<li>Linear function approximation is used to approximate value functions, which are defined as the inner product of a weight vector and feature vector.</li>
<li>The update rule for linear function approximation involves taking the difference between the current estimate and the target value, multiplying it by the learning rate, and adding the product of the feature vector and the weight vector.</li>
<li>Eligibility traces are used to efficiently update past states in TD learning, which helps in accounting for new temporal difference errors without recomputing values or storing individual features.</li>
<li>The speaker discusses the equivalence between Monte Carlo updates and TD updates, and mentions that both methods can be applied online or offline.</li>
<li>Mixed multistep returns combine the benefits of both TD and Monte Carlo learning by using a weighted average of n-step returns and one-step returns.</li>
<li>The speaker also touches upon the importance of considering computational properties and the independence of span prediction when choosing between TD and Monte Carlo methods.</li>

<ul>
<li>The lecture is about advanced topics in model-free control, specifically focusing on value functions and policy improvement in reinforcement learning.</li>
<li>Model-free control tries to optimize the value function first in policy evaluation.</li>
<li>Policy iteration involves interleaving two steps: policy evaluation and policy improvement.</li>
<li>In policy evaluation, an arbitrary initial value function is used, which is then updated based on the current policy's evaluations.</li>
<li>In policy improvement, a new policy is found by making the policy greedy with respect to the current value function.</li>
<li>Policy iteration can be seen as a way to replace V(Q) in model three estimation.</li>
<li>Monte Carlo control uses the full return, including the reward from the current state and all future discounted rewards.</li>

<ul>
<li>The speaker started by discussing the understanding of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and dynamic programming as a solution method.</li>
<li>Dynamic programming is a mathematical optimization technique used to solve sequential decision-making problems.</li>
<li>Policy evaluation was introduced as the first application of dynamic programming in MDPs, where an agent evaluates a given policy to determine its expected reward.</li>
<li>Value iteration was presented as another approach related to policy evaluation, which directly optimizes the value function using the Bellman equation.</li>
<li>The speaker mentioned that dynamic programming can be extended to handle various problems and lead to subsequent lectures on planning in MDPs.</li>
<li>Dynamic programming is used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems and solving each one efficiently.</li>
<li>The optimal substructure principle and optimality property were discussed as essential concepts in dynamic programming.</li>
<li>The speaker planned to use dynamic programming to try and solve an MDP problem later in the course.</li>
<li>Dynamic programming is widely used in various fields, including scheduling algorithms, string algorithms, graph algorithms, and machine learning models like LTI and bioinformatics.</li>
<li>The speaker then focused on planning in MDPs and introduced the concept of a planning problem, which involves finding an optimal policy given full knowledge of the environment.</li>
<li>Planning in MDPs can be addressed through prediction control, where the goal is to predict the reward achieved by different policies and choose the best one.</li>
<li>The speaker mentioned that they would consider two special cases of planning in MDPs: prediction and control.</li>
<li>In prediction, the goal is to determine the expected reward given a policy, while in control, the goal is to find the optimal policy that maximizes long-term reward.</li>
<li>The speaker then provided an example of a simple grid world problem to illustrate dynamic programming concepts.</li>
<li>They discussed how to use iterative policy evaluation to compute the value function for a given policy and improve it by applying the Bellman equation iteratively.</li>
<li>The speaker also mentioned that there is a formal proof of the uniqueness property of the solution in MDPs, which they would cover later. * The speaker discusses policy evaluation and improvement in the context of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)</li>
<li>Jack's Car Rental is used as a real-world example to illustrate the concepts</li>
<li>MDP: Markov Decision Process, state space, action space, reward function, transition probability</li>

<ul>
<li>The speaker is discussing model-free prediction methods in reinforcement learning.</li>
<li>Monte Carlo Learning (MCL) and Temporal Difference Learning (TD) are two major methods for model-free prediction.</li>
<li>MCL uses sample returns to estimate value functions by taking the average of returns from multiple episodes. It requires the assumption that the environment is stationary, which may not hold in reality.</li>
<li>TD learning looks one step ahead to estimate the return and updates the value function iteratively. It unifies the approach towards solving the value function problem.</li>
<li>MCL and TD are related, but there is a distinction between planning and prediction in reinforcement learning.</li>
<li>Model-free methods aim to find the optimal policy without knowing the environment dynamics or reward function.</li>
<li>Monte Carlo policy evaluation uses empirical mean returns to estimate the expected return of a policy. It requires visiting each state multiple times to reduce variance.</li>
<li>TD learning updates the value function based on the difference between estimated and observed returns, which is called the TD error. It can converge faster than Monte Carlo methods but may require more computational resources.</li>
<li>The speaker mentions an example of Blackjack as a simplified MDP problem and explains how to represent it using state variables.</li>
<li>Monte Carlo policy evaluation involves running many episodes of the game, evaluating each state based on the policy, and updating the value function accordingly. The algorithm converges to the true value function as the number of episodes increases but may be noisy for rare states or when the number of episodes is not large enough.</li>
<li>The speaker mentions that Monte Carlo methods can be extended to online algorithms, where estimates are updated after each step instead of waiting for the end of an episode.</li>
<li>TD learning uses bootstrapping, which involves estimating the value function based on the current estimate and the observed return, to make more efficient updates.</li>
<li>The speaker mentions that both MCL and TD methods have advantages and disadvantages, with MCL being simpler but less efficient for large state spaces and TD being more complex but more efficient for smaller state spaces.</li>
<li>The speaker also mentions that reinforcement learning algorithms can be developed towards online algorithms, where statistics are not maintained incrementally, and the estimates are updated after each step. * TD learning: Temporal Difference (TD) method for estimating value function</li>
<li>TD0: Simplest version of TD, uses estimated return one step instead of real return</li>
<li>Bellman equation: Value function equals expected reward plus discounted value next step</li>
<li>TD Target: Estimate taking a step, difference between estimated and actual value</li>
<li>Monte Carlo learning: Wait for end of episode to observe entire trajectory and compute return</li>
<li>Advantages of TD over Monte Carlo:</li>
<li>Faster convergence as it updates at every step instead of waiting for an episode to finish</li>
<li>Can handle incomplete sequences, unlike Monte Carlo which requires the full sequence to estimate the value function</li>
<li>Bias-Variance tradeoff: TD introduces bias by using an estimate for the next step's value instead of the true value, but this reduces variance compared to Monte Carlo</li>
<li>TD Lambda: A variant of TD that allows choosing between shallow and deep backups according to a parameter lambda.</li>
<li>Shallow vs Deep Backup:</li>
<li>Shallow backup: One-step update towards estimated value function</li>
<li>Deep backup: Full width update considering every possibility exhaustively</li>
<li>Methods in reinforcement learning: Policy evaluation, policy control</li>
<li>Bootstrapping: Using an estimate for the next step's value instead of the true value to update the current value estimate. * TD Lambda is a unifying algorithm for temporal difference (TD) learning, which lets us pick the best place to update values based on depth or shallowness</li>
<li>TD Lambda uses a Lambda return, which is a geometrically weighted average of returns from different steps</li>
<li>TD Lambda works by looking at the value function one step ahead and updating it based on the observed reward and the next estimated value</li>
<li>TD Lambda can give incorrect answers in some cases, such as in stochastic MDPs where we may get the wrong answer due to the Markov property</li>
<li>The intuition behind TD Lambda is that taking one step in reality always gives us a more accurate estimate than looking backwards from the current state</li>
<li>TD Lambda converges like contraction math and brings us closer to the ground truth with each step</li>
<li>TD Lambda can be compared to Monte Carlo learning, which uses random sampling to estimate returns, but TD Lambda is more efficient and exploits the market property of lower variance</li>
<li>TD Lambda has a sweet spot around 3-5 steps for the Lambda return, where it performs best</li>
<li>TD Lambda can be used in both online and offline learning, and it is robust to changes in the environment</li>
<li>TD Lambda uses eligibility traces to efficiently assign credit for errors and update the value function</li>
<li>TD Lambda has a forward view and a backward view, which are equivalent but have different advantages: the forward view computes end-of-episode returns and averages them, while the backward view accumulates eligibility traces and updates them efficiently</li>
<li>Recent work has shown that TD Lambda can even achieve equivalence with online updating.</li>

<li>Model-free control involves using tools like state value functions and Q-learning to estimate and optimize policies without knowing the underlying dynamics of the environment</li>
<li>The speaker mentions various applications of reinforcement learning, including controlling elevators, self-driving cars, and playing games</li>
<li>In an unknown MDP (Markov Decision Process), model-free control can be useful when sampling is the only way to access the model</li>
<li>Real-world examples of complex systems that could benefit from model-free control include atomic-level simulations and controlling a bioreactor</li>
<li>The speaker discusses the dichotomy between policy learning and policy improvement, and how they are related</li>
<li>Policy iteration involves alternating between evaluating and improving policies</li>

<li>Epsilon-greedy exploration is a simple way to ensure exploration while making progress towards finding the best policy. * The speaker discusses various reinforcement learning algorithms, focusing on Q-learning and SARSA</li>
<li>Q-learning estimates the value of a state-action pair by taking actions and observing rewards and next states</li>
<li>SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action) is an extension of Q-learning that uses eligibility traces to estimate the value of a state-action pair based on the most recent reward received</li>
<li>Eligibility traces keep track of how recently each state-action pair has been visited and decay over time</li>
<li>The speaker discusses the advantages of online learning, which allows for immediate updates as new data becomes available</li>
<li>TD(Lambda) is a variant of Q-learning that uses eligibility traces with discounting to estimate the value of a state-action pair based on the sum of rewards received along a trajectory</li>
<li>The speaker discusses the importance of choosing an appropriate Lambda parameter, which determines how far back in the trajectory to consider rewards when updating the Q-value</li>
<li>The speaker mentions that using a large Lambda parameter allows for faster information flow backwards along the trajectory and can help overcome the "tyranny of the time step"</li>
<li>The speaker also discusses the importance of tuning the Lambda parameter to balance control bias, variance, and the SU effect (bootstrapping error)</li>
<li>The speaker mentions that in online learning, updates are made every single step based on the most recent reward received, even if the episode is not yet finished. * The speaker discusses forming estimates of expected reward in reinforcement learning</li>
<li>Two methods mentioned: Monte Carlo and Temporal Difference (TD) learning</li>
<li>Monte Carlo learning forms true mean by using the count of number of times a state-action pair has been visited</li>
<li>TD learning uses bootstrapping to form an estimate of the expected reward based on the current value estimation</li>
<li>Importance sampling is mentioned as a mechanism for estimating expectations in Monte Carlo learning</li>
