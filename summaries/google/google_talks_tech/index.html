<ul>
<li>Discussion on artificial intelligence (AI) and its future impact.</li>
<li>AI is advancing rapidly, with the rate of progress in AI development similar to that of human evolution.</li>
<li>AI will eventually surpass humans in intelligence and decision-making capabilities.</li>
<li>Ethical considerations should be incorporated into AI development from the beginning.</li>

<h2 id="how-data-happened-chris-wiggins-matthew-l-jones-talks-at-google">How Data Happened | Chris Wiggins &amp; Matthew L. Jones | Talks at Google</h2>
<p>URL: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfBFjbVKCLc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfBFjbVKCLc</a></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The speakers discussed the book "How Data Happened: A History" by Chris Wiggins and Matthew L. Jones, which explores the history of data science and its connection to ethics, politics, and algorithms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They highlighted how data collection has evolved over time, starting with pencil-and-paper calculations in Bletchley Park (1930s) to modern digital computation (1940s).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The book emphasizes the importance of Bayesian statistics and its role in cryptography, which later influenced modern data analysis techniques like machine learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They discussed the concept of social physics, a term used for analyzing human behavior using mathematical models. This was introduced by Udny Yule in the 19th century.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The book also examines the history of statistical significance testing and its impact on modern data science. It suggests that the field has evolved from a focus on hypothesis testing to one centered around algorithmic decision-making.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Privacy concerns are discussed, with the speakers noting how the definition of privacy has changed over time. The recent growth in large language models (LLMs) is seen as an exciting development but also raises ethical and political questions regarding their use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Health data is a particularly challenging area for privacy regulation due to its clinical and political importance. Aggregated metadata, such as phone records, has raised similar concerns about potential harm caused by data analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The book "How Data Happened" emerged organically from conversations between the authors and their students at Columbia University. The speakers emphasized the importance of understanding history to make informed decisions in the present day.</p>

<h2 id="gerd-gigerenzer-how-to-stay-smart-in-a-smart-world-talks-at-google">Gerd Gigerenzer | How to Stay Smart in a Smart World | Talks at Google</h2>
<p>URL: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-xHvfScG_c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-xHvfScG_c</a></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>During the talk, Gerd Gigerenzer discussed the limitations of AI and its application in different scenarios. He emphasized the importance of understanding human intelligence and using simple heuristics to make decisions in situations with high uncertainty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the context of healthcare, the recency heuristic was used as an example of a simple algorithm that outperformed complex AI models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The concept of adapt-to-AI was introduced. It suggests redesigning cities and environments to accommodate self-driving cars rather than making them autonomous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gigerenzer highlighted the importance of privacy, dignity, and transparency in dealing with data. He argued that people should be aware of how their data is being used and have control over it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nudging was discussed as a way to help individuals make better decisions. It involves providing information and guidance without forcing them to act in a certain way.</p>

<ul>
<li>César Hidalgo presented a study on how humans judge machines and vice versa.</li>
<li>Moral function in human judgment is based on intention, harm, and wrongness.</li>
<li>People tend to forgive machine mistakes if they're accidental, but hold humans accountable for similar mistakes.</li>
<li>The intention of humans and machines can be perceived differently depending on context.</li>
<li>When judging a moral dilemma involving a human and a machine, people prefer preserving the human over the machine, even if it means causing harm to the human.</li>
<li>People judge autonomous vehicles based on their cultural background. For example, Saudis are more likely to blame the driver for accidents, while Americans tend to blame the car manufacturer.</li>
<li>There is a difference in judgment between people with higher education and lower education. Those with higher education tend to be more forgiving of machines.</li>
<li>When it comes to self-driving cars, people judge based on their cultural background and level of trust.</li>
<li>People are more likely to blame the driver for accidents involving autonomous vehicles if they're from a collectivist culture. In contrast, individualistic cultures tend to blame the machine or manufacturer.</li>
<li>People prefer machines that can learn and adapt to new tasks over those that perform specific tasks well.</li>
<li>People judge moral dilemmas differently based on their cultural background. For example, Americans focus on harm while Asians focus more on intention.</li>
<li>In a self-driving car scenario, people tend to blame the driver if they're from a collectivist culture and blame the machine or manufacturer if they're from an individualistic culture.</li>
<li>People are more likely to forgive machines for accidents if they have higher education.</li>
<li>When judging autonomous vehicles, people consider both cultural background and level of trust in self-driving technology.</li>
<li>In a moral dilemma involving a human and machine, people tend to prefer preserving the human over the machine. However, this preference may vary across cultures.</li>
