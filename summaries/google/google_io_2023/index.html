<ul>
<li>Auriel Wright, Skin tone plays a significant role in how users are treated and interact with technology.<ul>
<li>Numerous examples exist where industries have failed to create products that work well for various skin tones.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Google's Skin Tone Team aims to help build products that function effectively for everyone, regardless of their skin tone.<ul>
<li>The team consists of UXRs, a colorism expert, research scientists, and engineers who leverage their expertise to minimize skin-tone inequity in ML products.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Google uses ML Fairness Evaluation to understand common human biases manifested in ML algorithms ultimately affecting the product.<ul>
<li>Over the past year, they've been working with Dr. Monk to validate the MST scale and apply it in their work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Teams within Google use the MST scale for ML labeling tasks, ethnographic research, fairness testing, and as a guiding principle for computer vision fairness workflow.<ul>
<li>They've broken down four key principles to practice inclusive product development: Testing, Annotating Data Responsibly, Including Skin Tone in Image Processing, and Following Google's AI Principles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When developing an inclusive product, it is essential to ensure that the training and evaluation data sets include representation across the entire MST scale.<ul>
<li>This means accounting for a diverse range of people and tone categories within the dataset.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Inclusive evaluations involve testing algorithms and products with various skin tones to ensure they perform similarly.<ul>
<li>In practice, this looks like using metrics that measure performance consistently across different skin-tone groups.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Intersectional slicing allows for a more nuanced understanding of how different attributes interact within the product development process.<ul>
<li>This involves testing whether models perform well in specific subgroups based on multiple factors such as gender, age, and perceived expression.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To annotate data responsibly, practitioners should use the MST scale to capture nuances in skin tone accurately.<ul>
<li>They should avoid grouping points into categories like light, medium, or dark, which can hide important nuances.</li>
<li>It's also helpful to enlist geographically diverse sets of annotators within one region and get at least two raters per region to reduce variation and achieve a global consensus.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lighting plays an essential role in rating data and annotating skin tone, as it impacts perception significantly.<ul>
<li>Practitioners should consider this factor when working with data sets and ensure they account for variations in lighting conditions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Finally, practitioners should avoid equating race with skin tone when developing ML fairness efforts.<ul>
<li>It's crucial to remember that skin tone and race are two distinct concepts, and models must account for differences within ethnic groups.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p>Uploading a JSON file containing the domain, subdomains, and verification status to Google Play Console for website validation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>New Tools for Deep Link Management</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Google Ads iOS Validator</strong>: A new tool launched by Google Ads that performs a series of checks on an iOS app's deep link configuration based on the link entered and the app's Apple App Site Association file. It provides recommendations to fix misconfigured links.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>New Deep Links Page in Google Play Console</strong>: A new page dedicated to deep link setup per app version, which tracks active versions and highlights potential issues requiring fixes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Examples of Successful Deep Link Implementation</strong></p>

<h2 id="how-to-reduce-reliance-on-passwords-in-android-apps-with-passkey-support">How to reduce reliance on passwords in Android apps with passkey support</h2>
<p>URL: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36peNZUlgzU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36peNZUlgzU</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction: Niharika and Diego introduce the topic of reducing reliance on passwords by adding passkey support to Android apps.</li>
<li>Passkeys: New form of passwordless authentication, based on public cryptography, simpler and safer than phishable authentication methods.</li>
<li>How it works: When creating a passkey, user's device generates private-public key pair. Public key sent to server; user keeps the private key. User then uses their device's screen lock (like fingerprint or face unlock) to sign in. Passkeys are synchronized across user's Android devices and can be used wherever needed.</li>
<li>Benefits: Simpler, more secure authentication process with multifactor authentication, single tap for quicker sign-in, and less chance of phishing attacks.</li>
<li>Credential Manager API: New unified API that consolidates support for passkeys, traditional authentication methods, and federated sign-in. It brings together multiple sign-in methods into a single interface, making the login experience simpler and more user-friendly.</li>
<li>Password Managers: Several leading password managers like 1Password, Dashlane, Keeper, and Okta are available on Android 14 launch, with many expected to be available shortly after.</li>
<li>Developer Benefits: Credential Manager supports multiple sign-in mechanisms within a single API, making it easier for developers to integrate different authentication methods and maintain ongoing maintenance. It also helps in transitioning towards a passwordless future.</li>
<li>Real-world example: Kayak implemented passkey support using Credential Manager Android, making account creation lightning fast and removing the need for traditional password creation processes.</li>
<li>Integration process: To register a passkey, users must first sign into an app using traditional authentication methods (like passwords or federated identity). Once signed in, they are prompted to create a passkey by authenticating biometrics. The generated passkey is then saved in the user's preferred password manager and public key credential information returned to the app.</li>
<li>Sign-in process: Similar to registration, users must first sign into an app using traditional authentication methods. Once signed in, they are prompted to authenticate their passkey (including signature) using biometrics or another secure method.</li>
<li>Future plans: Firebase Authentication and Google Cloud Identity Platform plan to bring passkey support for developers soon, providing them with a modern, secure out-of-the-box authentication solution for apps built on major mobile web platforms.</li>

<ul>
<li>Kotlin is a supported language for Android since 2017, with over 95% of top thousand apps in the Play Store using it directly or indirectly.</li>
<li>The latest version of Kotlin (Kotlin 20) has a new compiler called K2, which offers twice as fast compilation speed compared to the previous compiler.</li>
<li>Gradle Kotlin DSL is a way to define build scripts in a more readable and maintainable format. It's now the default option in the latest Android Studio preview (Android Studio Giraffe).</li>
<li>Kotlin Symbol Processing (KSP) is an alternative to KAPT that analyzes Kotlin code directly, resulting in faster build times and better understanding of language constructs. It's recommended to migrate dependencies from KAPT to KSP whenever possible.</li>
<li>Kotlin Multiplatform allows developers to share business logic across platforms like Android, iOS, and web by writing Kotlin code that compiles into platform-specific binaries. Google Workspace is experimenting with this technology for their internal projects.</li>

<li>
<p>Kaz Sato and Holt Skinner introduce the concept of enterprise search, highlighting its three main challenges: handling large amounts of data in various formats at scale, implementing traditional keyword search restricted especially with AI-powered recommendations, and taking advantage of generative AI LLMs for information retrieval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The speakers discuss Google Cloud's Gen App Builder, which allows developers to create enterprise search services easily without having to build the entire DevOps team or manage infrastructure themselves. It supports creating search engines, chat interfaces, and integrating with existing applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They demonstrate how to set up a basic search engine using structured and unstructured data sources such as websites and cloud storage files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The speakers then discuss semantic search technology, which allows users to find content based on its meaning rather than just keywords. This is achieved by converting raw data into embeddings that represent the content's meaning in a high-dimensional space. These embeddings can be used across various Google services like Google Search and YouTube for better recommendation systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, they showcase how LLM capabilities can enhance enterprise search experiences by providing summaries of search results and enabling multimodal searches (e.g., searching for an image or text related to a specific product). These features improve information retrieval productivity in various industries such as retail, finance, and healthcare.</p>

<ul>
<li>Intro: Lingkai Shen introduces Sally, a software engineer who wants to adopt best practices for setting up staging and production environments.</li>
<li>Current Approach: Sally currently uses the Firebase Console to create and manage two separate Firebase projects for staging and production.</li>
<li>Problems with Current Approach: It's time-consuming, not scalable, and there's a risk of accidentally breaking the production environment.</li>
<li>Introducing Terraform for Firebase Integration: Lingkai explains that Terrafire is an open-source tool from HashiCorp that allows managing infrastructure code. It can be used to describe and provision resources in the cloud, including those provided by Firebase.</li>
<li>Setting Up a Prod Project with Terraform: Sally creates a Terraform configuration file for her production project. She uses the <code>googlebeta</code> provider and sets up authentication, Firestore database, etc.</li>
<li>Adding Firebase Resources: Sally adds platform variants (Android, iOS, web) to her production project using Terraform resource blocks. She also sets up authentication and Firestore database.</li>
<li>Enabling Services: To enable certain services for the production project, Sally uses the <code>Service Usage API</code> and <code>Firebase Management API</code>.</li>
<li>Creating a Staging Project with Terraform: Sally copies her production project's Terraform configuration file, tweaks it slightly to create a staging project. She can reuse most of the code from the production project without copying it.</li>
<li>Managing Changes in Infrastructure: If Sally wants to make changes to the infrastructure (e.g., update security rules for Firestore), she simply modifies her Terraform configuration files and runs <code>terraform apply</code> again. This ensures that both staging and production environments stay synchronized.</li>
<li>Benefits of Using Terraform: By using Terraform, Sally can manage multiple similar Firebase projects confidently. It allows her to track changes in the infrastructure, test new features on the staging environment before deploying them to production, and easily replicate resources across different environments.</li>

<ul>
<li>Defining AI: Artificial intelligence (AI) is a concept that refers to programming computers to react to data in an intelligent, human-like manner.</li>
<li>Machine Learning: Machine learning (ML) is a technique used to help computers understand the content of data. It involves showing the computer many examples and allowing it to learn how to classify new data on its own.</li>
<li>Data Processing: Before training a machine learning model, developers often need to process, cleanse, and filter the data to make it more useful for the subsequent steps.</li>
<li>Model Creation: Developers use high-level frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras to create and train their models. These tools allow them to define the architecture of their model without needing a deep understanding of the underlying mathematical theories.</li>
<li>Deployment: Once a model has been trained, it needs to be deployed so that people can use it. This often involves integrating the model with existing systems and handling data interfacing between different platforms.</li>
<li>Ongoing Improvement: After deploying a model, developers must continually gather data and work on improving the model based on user feedback. This process is called Operations (Ops) or MLOps in the context of machine learning.</li>
<li>Accelerated Infrastructure: Advanced hardware like GPUs and TPUs can speed up the training and deployment of machine learning models by making them more efficient.</li>
<li>Responsible AI: Developers must also consider the ethical implications of their work when creating AI systems, as these technologies have the potential to impact society in significant ways.</li>

<h2 id="learn-passkeys-for-simpler-and-safer-sign-in">Learn passkeys for simpler and safer sign-in</h2>
<p>URL: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8ueIn2Nlc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8ueIn2Nlc</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction to Passkeys<ul>
<li>Passkeys are a simpler, much safer authentication method that replaces passwords and second factors.</li>
<li>They work across devices and browsers such as Mac OS, iOS, iPadOS, Windows, Android, Chrome, Edge, and Safari.</li>
<li>Passkeys protect users from phishing attacks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Benefits of Passkeys<ul>
<li>Users can sign in using their device's screen lock or biometric authentication (e.g., fingerprint or facial recognition).</li>
<li>Creating and remembering unique complex passwords is a big pain for many users, but passkeys make this process simpler with just one touch.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How Passkeys Work<ul>
<li>Developers store public keys instead of passwords, making it harder for bad actors to obtain sensitive information.</li>
<li>Passkeys are compatible with web apps and can be used on ecommerce websites like Shopify.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>User Journey Example: Shopping using a passkey in the Shop app<ul>
<li>Users set up fingerprint unlock and upgrade their password to a passkey.</li>
<li>When shopping online, users sign in using their saved passkey without needing to enter an email address or password.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cross-device Synchronization<ul>
<li>Passkeys are automatically synchronized across devices via password managers like Google Password Manager.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implementing Passkeys<ul>
<li>Web developers can use the standard API called Web Authentication (WebAuthn) for web apps.</li>
<li>For Android apps, developers should use the Credential Manager library and associate their app with a web domain using JSON files.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Passkey vs. Traditional Authentication Methods<ul>
<li>Passkeys are more secure than traditional password-based authentication methods because they use public key cryptography to generate signatures that verify user identities.</li>
<li>Two-factor authentication (2FA) is another alternative, but it's less secure than passkeys and can be inconvenient for users who need to enter codes sent via SMS or email.</li>
<li>Identity federation allows websites to delegate authentication-related complexity and security challenges to identity providers like Google or PayPal. This method is complementary to passkeys and doesn't require third-party cookies, unlike traditional methods.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Future of Passkeys<ul>
<li>As more developers adopt passkey technology, users will experience a simpler, safer world without passwords. The speaker encourages everyone to start integrating authentication systems soon.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="preparing-for-the-end-of-third-party-cookies">Preparing for the end of third-party cookies</h2>

<ul>
<li>Helen Cho and Kaustubha Govind are the speakers at a conference discussing Privacy Sandbox.</li>
<li>Chrome will soon deprecate support for third-party cookies, and developers must prepare their websites accordingly.</li>
<li>The Privacy Sandbox suite proposal aims to address the issue of pervasive tracking on the web.</li>
<li>Tools like Web HTTP Cache Partitioning, User Agent String Reduction, Network State Partitioning, and Storage Partitioning have already been implemented to help with this transition.</li>
<li>The Chromium team has proposed CHIPS (Cookies Having Independent Partition State) as an alternative to third-party cookies.</li>
<li>FirstParty Sets is another proposal that helps facilitate cookie access support for user-impacting functionality across a site's first-party domain.</li>
<li>Developers can use the Storage Access API to request storage access for specific domains within their sets.</li>
<li>Users will be able to control their privacy settings in Chrome, allowing them to toggle access to FirstParty Sets and see which websites are part of their visited set.</li>

<ul>
<li>Introduction to Attribution Reporting API in Privacy Sandbox<ul>
<li>Jolyn Yao, Georgia Franklin, and Erin Walsh introduce themselves and their roles in the development of the Privacy Sandbox.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Vision and goals of Privacy Sandbox<ul>
<li>The vision involves rethinking building together for privacy on Chrome and Android platforms.</li>
<li>Key use cases are supported by purpose-built technology, transparent, open collaboration, and consulting stakeholders across industries to ensure everyone's vision is realized.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Three main advertising-focused APIs developed for web and Android platforms<ul>
<li>The three main advertising-focused APIs are: 1) Attribution Reporting API, 2) FLEDGE (Federated Learning of Cohorts), and 3) TURTLEDOVE.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Core measurement goal aligned with privacy<ul>
<li>The core measurement goal is to enable conversion measurement without needing data on individual users. Instead, it focuses on large patterns and robust outliers to provide business decision-making insights.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Platform support for identifier tracking<ul>
<li>Platforms like Chrome and Android previously used identifiers such as third-party cookies and device IDs to track user behavior across websites and apps. However, these methods have been criticized for privacy concerns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Purpose-built platform APIs like Attribution Reporting API<ul>
<li>The Privacy Sandbox supports purpose-built platform APIs like the Attribution Reporting API as a privacy-preserving alternative to legacy technology such as third-party cookies and device IDs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Workflow of Attribution Reporting API<ul>
<li>When an ad is clicked, the advertiser registers the event using the Attribution Reporting API. If the user later engages with the advertiser (e.g., makes a purchase), the advertiser registers this conversion event. The API sends an event-level summary report with randomized delay and structural limits to prevent tracking of individual users.</li>
<li>Two types of reports are generated: 1) Event-level reporting, which provides high-fidelity line-item data for each ad event that occurs; and 2) Summary reporting, which is used for higher-level insights such as ROI analysis and campaign performance reporting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Privacy protection measures in Attribution Reporting API<ul>
<li>The privacy protection measures implemented in the Attribution Reporting API include: 1) Structural limits to prevent the identification of individual users; 2) Noise rate limit applied to prevent the use of limited data for tracking purposes; and 3) Reporting windows, which delay sending reports on data older than 30 days.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Summary report generation process<ul>
<li>The summary report is generated by aggregating data from multiple sources and adding noise to prevent tracking of individual users. The aggregated data is then processed in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) before being returned to the advertiser as a summarized value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cross-web app attribution support in Privacy Sandbox<ul>
<li>The Privacy Sandbox natively supports cross-web app attribution, allowing advertisers to track conversions across both web and app environments on Chrome and Android platforms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Developer enrollment process for Privacy Sandbox APIs<ul>
<li>Developers must enroll themselves using a new process that includes verifying their identity, providing contact details, and inputting necessary API server configuration information. This process helps ensure that developers are properly authorized to use the Privacy Sandbox APIs and limits the risk of misuse or improper usage beyond intended purposes.</li>
