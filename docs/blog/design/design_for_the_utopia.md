# Designing for Utopia in a Dystopian Era: Insights from Chris Atherton's GOTO 2022 Talk

In the compelling GOTO 2022 presentation, *Design for the Utopia You Want, Not the Dystopia You're In*, Chris Atherton provides a profound exploration of the intersection between design, psychology, and the socio-political landscape of our times. The talk, available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q77GT8srcsQ), delves into how designers and individuals can navigate the complex web of modern challenges to foster a more utopian society.

### The Designer's Dilemma

Atherton opens by identifying as a designer deeply interested in human needs and motivations. The talk pivots on the critical role designers play in shaping human interaction with technology and, by extension, each other. By understanding user interactions, designers can create or adapt tools that enhance or impede human agency. The speaker emphasizes the need to be vigilant about how designs are used, often in ways never intended, highlighting the adaptability required in both creation and utilization.

### Navigating Dystopian Themes

The discussion dives into the prevalence of dystopian themes in popular culture, from *Blade Runner* to *Terminator*, contrasting them with the more insidious and real dystopias we face today â€” like climate change and pandemics. Atherton examines "techwear," a fashion response to dystopian themes, and how it has evolved from a testosterone-heavy aesthetic to a more inclusive one. Despite the grim realities we face, the presentation encourages finding humor and humanity even in dark times.

### Technology and Agency

A significant part of the talk revolves around technology's impact on personal agency. From the privacy erosions on platforms like Facebook to the societal implications of Bitcoin mining, Atherton urges us to consider the pervasive and often unseen influence of technology on our lives. Furthermore, the speaker delves into the concept of *learned helplessness*, a psychological state when someone believes they have no control over their circumstances and stops trying to change them, often exacerbated by technology's relentless demands and complexities.

### Psychological Insights for a Utopian Future

Atherton brings in psychological theories to bolster her argument for mindful design and living. She references William James's attention theory, Martin Seligman's learned helplessness, and the mere exposure effect, among others, to explain how repeated, unexamined interactions with technology can shape our behaviors and beliefs in undesirable ways.

### Acting for the Utopia You Want

The crux of Atherton's message is a call to action. She cites Keanu Reeves's practice of not engaging in futile arguments and Greta Thunberg's advocacy for direct action towards the Utopia we desire. The talk underscores the importance of recognizing when we might be falling into patterns of learned helplessness and intentionally rehearsing things that we believe to be good, thereby actively participating in the creation of a better future.

### Concluding Thoughts

Chris Atherton's talk at the GOTO 2022 conference is more than a presentation; it's a rallying cry for designers, technologists, and citizens to introspect and act with intentionality. By understanding the psychological underpinnings of our interactions with technology and society, we can move towards a future that is less about adapting to dystopia and more about creating Utopia. The advice is clear: act for the Utopia you want, dress however you like, but importantly, take action against the forces that seek to diminish our agency and potential.

As we navigate these challenging times, let us draw inspiration from Atherton's insights and the examples set by figures like Reeves and Thunberg. Let's strive to recognize and overcome the learned helplessness that can ensnare us, choosing instead to engage in meaningful actions that lead us towards a more hopeful, utopian future.
