- Pick the right data structure, such as immutable data structures like transit or Falkor/Jason graph.
- Use frameworks that support immutability, like React, React Native, and Elm.
- Optimize data transfer with techniques like batching and caching.
- Consider atomic databases for efficient querying and editing capabilities.
- Adopt radical simplicity by representing queries directly in the UI components.
- Use well-tested engineering ideas such as Git and Lisp.
- Focus on removing complexity, even if it means adopting older technologies that have been proven effective.

1. The speaker discussed FRP (Functional Reactive Programming) and its applications in JavaScript.
2. They explained how RxJS is a reactive programming library that helps manage asynchronous tasks by treating events as first-class citizens.
3. The speaker provided examples of using RxJS to handle mouse interactions, dragging, and other UI events efficiently.
4. They mentioned some real-world applications of FRP, such as Facebook React, Netflix, SoundCloud, and Microsoft's Windows app.
5. The speaker also discussed the potential application of MVC (Model View Controller) in a reactive programming context.
