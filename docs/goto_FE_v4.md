1. **Introduction to HTTP/3**
   - HP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) has evolved over time, with the latest version being HP/3.
2. **HP/3 vs Previous Versions** 
   - HP/3 is designed for better performance and security compared to its predecessors.
   - It uses a new transport protocol called QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) which is built on top of UDP instead of TCP.
   - Unlike HTTP/2, HP/3 does not use multiplexing, instead it sends data in independent streams.
3. **QUIC Protocol** 
   - QUIC is a transport protocol designed to improve performance and security over the internet.
   - It uses UDP as its base protocol and adds features like encryption, congestion control, and error recovery.
4. **Key Features of HP/3**
   - Improved Performance: QUIC eliminates the need for TCP's three-way handshake, allowing faster connection establishment.
   - Security: All communication over QUIC is encrypted by default, providing better security than TCP or HTTP/2.
   - Independent Streams: In HP/3, each request and response is sent as a separate stream, allowing for more efficient use of network resources.
5. **Deployment Challenges** 
   - Organizations may need to update their firewalls and network infrastructure to support QUIC traffic.
   - Some ISPs still block UDP traffic due to its association with DDoS attacks.
6. **Future of HP/3** 
   - HP/3 is expected to become widely adopted in the coming years, as more browsers and servers implement support for it.
   - It may also lead to the development of new application protocols that take advantage of QUIC's features.

    - Technique 1: Start with a client-side application and introduce GraphQL server and frontend tools like Apollo and React Apollo.
    - Technique 2: Use the Polar Link Rest technique to start introducing REST APIs in a practical way for the frontend, using Apollo Client and Type Architecture.
    - Technique 3: Utilize GraphQL Mesh, which can automatically convert existing GraphQL schemas from different services into one graphical schema without affecting the source.
6. The speaker emphasized that these techniques can be used in any backend context and help developers move faster while focusing on frontend development.

## You Really Don't Need All that JavaScript, I Promise • Stuart Langridge • GOTO 2019

URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxlJRydqmk8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxlJRydqmk8)

1. **The Importance of Fast Web Performance**
    - First Meaningful Paint (FMP) is a crucial metric for assessing web performance.
    - A 27,000-file React website with an 85MB HTML file took 1 hour and 28 minutes to fully load one tweet, highlighting the need for optimization.
    - **The Impact of JavaScript on Web Performance**
        * Serving client-side JavaScript can slow down web apps.
        * Server-side rendering is a more efficient approach than client-side rendering.
    **Tactics to Improve Web Performance**
    1. **Efficient Use of JavaScript and Libraries**
        * Avoid unnecessary JavaScript code.
        * Minimize the use of libraries and frameworks.
        - **The Benefits of Serving Lean Client-side Code**
            * Smaller file sizes lead to faster load times.
            * Removing unneeded code can improve performance without sacrificing functionality.
    2. **Avoid Unnecessary Browser Requests**
        * Use treeshaking and bundling techniques to minimize the number of requests made by a webpage.
        - **The Importance of Compression, Minification, and Bundling**
            * These techniques can help reduce the size of files served to users, improving overall site performance.
    3. **Optimizing Availability**
        * A 2017 UK government study found that only 89% of people visiting a government website were able to load JavaScript enhancements.
        - **The Importance of Progressive Enhancement**
            * Building websites with progressive enhancement in mind ensures that users who do not have the latest technology can still access and use the site.
    4. **Addressing User Experience Challenges**
        * **The Imported Cost of Complexity**
            * The complexity of modern web development can lead to poor user experiences, as developers may struggle to ensure that their websites work correctly on all devices.
        - **The Importance of Building for the Web First**
            * Developers should focus on building websites that are optimized for the web first and forend then consider adding additional features or functionality.
    5. **The Benefits of Leveraging Existing Code**
        * Using existing code libraries and frameworks can help developers save time and effort, allowing them to build better websites more quickly.

## UX Tips to Avoid Losing Users' Attention • Chris Atherton • GOTO 2019

URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pixBU3EJfU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pixBU3EJfU)

1. Attention is a key factor in user experience design and can be influenced by various factors such as visual weight, contrast, movement, and layout.
2. Inattentional blindness occurs when people fail to notice unexpected changes or events in their environment due to focused attention on a specific task or object.
3. Designing for cognitive difficulties like ADHD and bipolar disorder involves understanding the challenges these individuals face in managing their attention and resisting distractions.
4. Reading comprehension can be hindered by factors such as low vision, contrast issues, and animations that distract from the text content.
5. Sleep deprivation can negatively impact cognitive performance and attention span, making it more difficult for individuals to focus on tasks and process information effectively.
6. Animation can be used to enhance user experience by guiding attention, providing feedback, and improving the overall visual appeal of a web page or application. However, care must be taken to ensure that animations do not distract from the main content or purpose of the interface.
