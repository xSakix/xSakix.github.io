  * Oracle disables older encryption protocols, such as SSLv3 and TLS 1.0/1.1, in their Java runtimes.
  * Updating your runtime ensures that you are using modern encryption to secure your applications.
- Upgrading within a release family vs. upgrading to a new version:
  * Upgrading within a release family requires less effort and risk compared to upgrading to a new version.
  * However, upgrading to a new version may offer significant benefits, such as new features and performance improvements.
- Redistributing updated Java runtimes:
  * When updating your Java runtime, you may need to redistribute the updated runtime to your users.
  * This can be done by providing them with the updated bytecode or a precompiled application.
- JMS (Java Message Service):
  * JMS is a messaging system that can help manage and distribute updates to your Java applications.
  * It can also provide advanced features, such as flight recording and centralized management of your Java runtimes.
- Using JMS for updating Java runtimes:
  * JMS can help you update your Java runtimes more efficiently by automating the process and providing advanced features.
  * You can use JMS to check which versions are installed, install new versions, and remove old ones.
- Advanced features in JMS:
  * JMS offers advanced features, such as flight recording and centralized management of your Java runtimes.
  * These features can help you monitor and manage your applications more effectively.
- Costs associated with using JMS:
  * Using JMS may involve additional costs, such as storage fees for data collected by the service.
  * However, these costs are typically outweighed by the benefits of using JMS to manage and update your Java runtimes.
