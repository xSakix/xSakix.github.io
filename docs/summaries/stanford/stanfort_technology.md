URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjqTpahgkGs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjqTpahgkGs)

- Federated Learning is a machine learning technique that trains a model on decentralized data across multiple parties.
- The key benefit of federated learning is privacy preservation, as the data remains at each party's location and never leaves their network.
- In the field of medicine, federated learning can be used to build predictive models for diseases like cancer or Alzheimer's.
- One challenge with federated learning is the need for a strong infrastructure that can handle the training and inference of models across multiple parties.
- Another challenge with federated learning is the need for a robust data platform that can store and manage the decentralized data being used to train the model.
- To address these challenges, several companies are developing platforms that support federated learning, such as the Alibaba Cloud Platform or the IBM Watson AI platform.
- One use case of federated learning in medicine is predicting survival for patients with cancer or mesothelioma using biopsy tissue samples and biopsy treatment images.
- In addition to predictive models, another important application of federated learning in medicine is building personalized care plans that take into account the unique needs and preferences of each individual patient.
- Another potential use case for federated learning in medicine is enabling hospitals to collaborate on research studies by sharing data and insights with one another without having to share sensitive patient information.
- One key challenge with implementing a federated learning system in healthcare is the need to ensure that the data being used to train the model is accurate, up-to-date, and free from any potential conflicts of interest.
- Another important consideration when implementing a federated learning system in healthcare is the need to ensure that all of the different parties involved in the training process are using consistent and compatible versions of the same underlying machine learning algorithm.
- One promising use case for federated learning in medicine is the ability to predict toxicity or drug resistance in patients with cancer or mesothelioma based on their biopsy tissue samples and imaging data sets.

## Stanford Seminar - Louis Thompson on Asia's High-Speed Rail

URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn3lBZO0ReM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn3lBZO0ReM)

- Overview of Asian high-speed rail systems
- Comparison with United States' passenger and freight rail systems
  - China: High speed rail carries a larger proportion of passengers than conventional rail, but freight rail is still the dominant mode.
  - Japan: A high degree of vertical integration exists between operation and track ownership in Japanese railways.
  - Taiwan/Korea/India: These countries have smaller railway networks with high-speed rail playing a more significant role in their overall transportation systems.
- Lessons learned from Asian high-speed rail systems
  - Clear mandate, deep experience, and stable financing are key factors for success in building and operating high-speed rail systems.
  - Public and private roles need to be clearly defined in order to ensure efficient planning and funding of projects.
  - The importance of local and regional planning, as well as the integration of national and local transportation networks, cannot be overstated.
- Challenges facing US high-speed rail development
  - Lack of a clear mandate or public support for high-speed rail systems has hindered progress in the United States.
  - Limited experience with private sector operation and management of passenger rail services makes it difficult to attract private investment.
  - The need for stable, long-term funding sources is critical for the success of any high-speed rail project.
- Potential opportunities for US high-speed rail development
  - Learning from Asian experiences can provide valuable insights into how to successfully plan and implement high-speed rail systems in the United States.
  - Collaborating with private sector partners may help overcome some of the barriers to private investment in passenger rail services.
  - Developing innovative financing mechanisms, such as public-private partnerships or concession agreements, could potentially attract more funding for high-speed rail projects.
- Future directions for US high-speed rail development
  - Continuing to learn from Asian experiences and adapting those lessons to the unique challenges faced by the United States will be crucial in moving forward with high-speed rail development.
  - Collaborating with private sector partners and exploring innovative financing mechanisms will likely play a key role in attracting the necessary funding for high-speed rail projects.
  - Addressing concerns related to security, safety, and environmental impact will be essential in gaining public support for high-speed rail systems in the United States.

        + mid-drive motors are more efficient and can provide more power, but are also more expensive and complex
    - ebikes can have different types of controllers, throttles, and displays depending on the manufacturer and model
    - ebike technology is constantly evolving and improving
- Ebike safety and regulation
    - ebikes are regulated differently in different countries and regions
        + some places have speed limits for ebikes, while others do not
        + some places require ebikes to have certain safety features, such as lights or reflectors
    - ebike accidents can happen, but they are generally less common than accidents involving traditional bikes or cars
- Ebike market trends and growth
    - the global ebike market is expected to grow at a steady rate of around 7.5% per year over the next five years
        + this growth is being driven by factors such as increasing urbanization, growing environmental concerns, and advances in technology
    - China is currently the largest market for ebikes, but Europe and North America are also expected to see significant growth in the coming years


## Stanford Seminar - SiGan Peng, Green Tech in Marine Transportation

- Introduction: Marine transportation is a significant contributor to global carbon dioxide emissions, primarily due to the use of bunker oil in marine diesel engines.
- Seawater scrubbing technology can be used to reduce sulfur oxide and particulate matter emissions from ships.
- Natural seawater scrubbing technology developed by Mr. SG Ping uses limestone to neutralize sulfur dioxide emissions from ship exhaust.
- The technology has been successfully implemented on over 1,000 ships since its development in the mid-2000s.
- Marine Protec, a California company founded by Mr. Ping, is commercializing and promoting the use of natural seawater scrubbing technology on ships.
- Question and answer session with Mr. Jerry Joe, Chief Marketing Officer of Marine Protec, follows the presentation.

## Summary of Presentation by Toshiyuki Kondo, President and CEO of Toray Composite America
- Carbon fiber is a material that has been developed since the 1970s. It is lightweight, strong, and resistant to corrosion.
- The carbon fiber industry is dominated by Japanese companies like Toray, Toho, Leon, and Mitsubishi Rayon.
- Carbon fiber has been used extensively in the aerospace industry since the 1980s. Boeing first applied it in secondary structures of their aircraft, then in primary structures starting with the 777 model in 1995. The use of carbon fiber in primary structures has led to significant weight reduction and fuel efficiency improvements.
- Carbon fiber is also used in automobiles, where it can reduce vehicle weight by up to 30%, leading to improved fuel efficiency and reduced CO2 emissions.
- Despite its advantages, the high cost of carbon fiber still makes it more expensive than steel. However, ongoing research and development efforts are aimed at reducing production costs and expanding the use of this material in various industries.
- Collaboration between automobile manufacturers, aerospace companies, and material producers is essential for further developing and implementing new technologies based on carbon fiber.
