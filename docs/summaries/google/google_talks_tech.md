## César Hidalgo | How Humans Judge Machines | Talks at Google

URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H10-t5hnnw0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H10-t5hnnw0)

    - César Hidalgo presented a study on how humans judge machines and vice versa.
    - Moral function in human judgment is based on intention, harm, and wrongness.
    - People tend to forgive machine mistakes if they're accidental, but hold humans accountable for similar mistakes.
    - The intention of humans and machines can be perceived differently depending on context.
    - When judging a moral dilemma involving a human and a machine, people prefer preserving the human over the machine, even if it means causing harm to the human.
    - People judge autonomous vehicles based on their cultural background. For example, Saudis are more likely to blame the driver for accidents, while Americans tend to blame the car manufacturer.
    - There is a difference in judgment between people with higher education and lower education. Those with higher education tend to be more forgiving of machines.
    - When it comes to self-driving cars, people judge based on their cultural background and level of trust.
    - People are more likely to blame the driver for accidents involving autonomous vehicles if they're from a collectivist culture. In contrast, individualistic cultures tend to blame the machine or manufacturer.
    - People prefer machines that can learn and adapt to new tasks over those that perform specific tasks well.
    - People judge moral dilemmas differently based on their cultural background. For example, Americans focus on harm while Asians focus more on intention.
    - In a self-driving car scenario, people tend to blame the driver if they're from a collectivist culture and blame the machine or manufacturer if they're from an individualistic culture.
    - People are more likely to forgive machines for accidents if they have higher education.
    - When judging autonomous vehicles, people consider both cultural background and level of trust in self-driving technology.
    - In a moral dilemma involving a human and machine, people tend to prefer preserving the human over the machine. However, this preference may vary across cultures.

  1. Nathalie Cabrol, a planetary scientist, discussed the Planetary Lake Lander (PLL) project.
   2. PLL is a robotic exploration mission for studying lakes and oceans on Earth to understand life on other planets.
   3. The goal was to study methane cycles in lakes and their impact on climate change.
   4. A TiME Lake Lander (TiLE) mission, similar to PLL, was proposed for Titan, Saturn's moon.
   5. The mission aimed at understanding carbon cycle, deglaciation, and habitability of the lake on Titan.
   6. An exploratory mission called TiME (Time and Life in Exoplanet Exploration) was planned for Titan.
   7. A robotic lander named Lake Lander would explore the alien sea, while a shore station would monitor environmental changes.
   8. The project faced challenges in communication due to distance and low data rate.
   9. PLL V2 was developed with improved communications and power systems for better performance.
   10. Data analysis showed that Titan's lake might be losing water, which could affect its climate change and methane cycle.
   11. The project aimed to develop a new generation of planetary explorers capable of adapting to changing environments.

4. Challenges in mapping the solar system:
   - Finding a standard coordinate system to map various celestial bodies
   - Collecting and processing large amounts of data
   - Understanding the dynamic nature of planets and their environments

5. Key takeaways from using maps for space exploration:
   - Maps provide context, allowing scientists to understand the environment they are studying
   - Accurate maps help in planning space missions and making informed decisions
   - Data analysis plays a crucial role in creating useful maps


## Smart SPHERES: Free-Flying Space Robots | Mark Micire | Talks at Google

URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEaheYVf3U0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEaheYVf3U0)

1. NASA's SPHERES project involves small, free-flying robots that perform complex tasks in space.
2. The project uses a Nexus S smartphone as a control and data logger for the SPHERES robots.
3. This phone has been modified to provide additional functionality, such as wifi connectivity with ISS, GPS tracking, and improved sensors.
4. The phone is attached to a SPHERE using Velcro and a custom-built case that allows it to fly while maintaining communication with the ground station.
5. The project aims to demonstrate how smartphones can be used for space exploration tasks like astronaut assistance, robotic control, and data logging.
6. Future plans include upgrading the phone hardware to improve performance and adding new features like a flashlight and an IR camera for night vision.
7. The SPHERES project has been successful in demonstrating the potential of smartphones in space applications.
