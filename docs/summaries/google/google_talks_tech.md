    - CÃ©sar Hidalgo presented a study on how humans judge machines and vice versa.
    - Moral function in human judgment is based on intention, harm, and wrongness.
    - People tend to forgive machine mistakes if they're accidental, but hold humans accountable for similar mistakes.
    - The intention of humans and machines can be perceived differently depending on context.
    - When judging a moral dilemma involving a human and a machine, people prefer preserving the human over the machine, even if it means causing harm to the human.
    - People judge autonomous vehicles based on their cultural background. For example, Saudis are more likely to blame the driver for accidents, while Americans tend to blame the car manufacturer.
    - There is a difference in judgment between people with higher education and lower education. Those with higher education tend to be more forgiving of machines.
    - When it comes to self-driving cars, people judge based on their cultural background and level of trust.
    - People are more likely to blame the driver for accidents involving autonomous vehicles if they're from a collectivist culture. In contrast, individualistic cultures tend to blame the machine or manufacturer.
    - People prefer machines that can learn and adapt to new tasks over those that perform specific tasks well.
    - People judge moral dilemmas differently based on their cultural background. For example, Americans focus on harm while Asians focus more on intention.
    - In a self-driving car scenario, people tend to blame the driver if they're from a collectivist culture and blame the machine or manufacturer if they're from an individualistic culture.
    - People are more likely to forgive machines for accidents if they have higher education.
    - When judging autonomous vehicles, people consider both cultural background and level of trust in self-driving technology.
    - In a moral dilemma involving a human and machine, people tend to prefer preserving the human over the machine. However, this preference may vary across cultures.

  1. Nathalie Cabrol, a planetary scientist, discussed the Planetary Lake Lander (PLL) project.
   2. PLL is a robotic exploration mission for studying lakes and oceans on Earth to understand life on other planets.
   3. The goal was to study methane cycles in lakes and their impact on climate change.
   4. A TiME Lake Lander (TiLE) mission, similar to PLL, was proposed for Titan, Saturn's moon.
   5. The mission aimed at understanding carbon cycle, deglaciation, and habitability of the lake on Titan.
   6. An exploratory mission called TiME (Time and Life in Exoplanet Exploration) was planned for Titan.
   7. A robotic lander named Lake Lander would explore the alien sea, while a shore station would monitor environmental changes.
   8. The project faced challenges in communication due to distance and low data rate.
   9. PLL V2 was developed with improved communications and power systems for better performance.
   10. Data analysis showed that Titan's lake might be losing water, which could affect its climate change and methane cycle.
   11. The project aimed to develop a new generation of planetary explorers capable of adapting to changing environments.
