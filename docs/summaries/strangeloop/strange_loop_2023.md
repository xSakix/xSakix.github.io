- OT Cheap Fundamental: Theum Procal Generator is a procedural content generation project.
- PCG can be used in games to create interesting and unique content.
- Three aspects of PCG: length, possibility space, and complexity.
- Length generator: Takes input size and generates output with the same size.
- Possibility space generator: Generates distinct artifacts with different properties.
- Cograph complexity: Measures pattern density in a graph.
- Tradeoffs exist between scale, pattern density, and uncoded knowledge cost.
- Balancing these tradeoffs can lead to interesting games like Borderlands or Minecraft.
- Simplified approximation for large generators (e.g., Wikipedia): Assume they operate on the same order of magnitude as their input.
- Stable Diffusion generator: Assumes 8000 images are distinct enough, with an average image size of 126 MB.
- PCG can be used to generate unique content for various applications like games or AI systems.
