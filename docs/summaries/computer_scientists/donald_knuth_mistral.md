  * This method uses pointers to neighbors and is less efficient than dancing cells.
* The speaker then explains how dancing cells can be used to solve exact covering problems more efficiently.
  * Dancing cells use an array with three components (item, color, Lo) and a set for each item.
  * The data structure allows quick navigation and elimination of options as the problem is solved.
* The speaker provides a detailed example of how dancing cells can be used to solve the toy problem.
  * He demonstrates how decisions are made, sub-problems are created, and options are deleted.
* The speaker discusses the advantages of using dancing cells to solve exact covering problems.
