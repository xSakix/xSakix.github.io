## USENIX ATC '23 - Accelerating Distributed MoE Training and Inference with Lina

URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsb4j6hHAaA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsb4j6hHAaA)

1. Moe (Mixed Expert) is a mixture expert system that combines multiple experts to improve performance and efficiency.
2. It has been applied in various NLP tasks using Transformer models, such as Glam Moe and Deep Speed's Moe model.
3. The main idea behind Moe is to select the most suitable expert for each input data sample based on a gating network that assigns weights to each expert output.
4. Moe architecture aims to benefit from sparsity computation, which reduces the number of flops and allows for larger models with low computational cost.
5. Training involves balancing loss across experts to ensure even data distribution among them. This is achieved by introducing a low-balancing loss added during training and removing it in the inference stage.
6. Distributed systems are often used to efficiently train and infer Moe models, as they can leverage parallelism and reduce communication costs.
7. One of the main challenges with Moe models is the performance bottleneck caused by Ottawa (a communication-intensive operation) during distributed training and inference.
8. To address this issue, Lina (Linear Scheduler) has been proposed to improve resource allocation and scheduling in Moe models. It aims to balance load among devices in a cluster and minimize the impact of performance bottlenecks.
9. Lina introduces a two-phase scheduling process: phase one involves estimating expert popularity based on token selection patterns, while phase two fine-tunes resource allocation based on actual routing decisions.
10. Evaluation results show that Lina can significantly improve the efficiency of Moe models during both training and inference stages, achieving near-optimal performance with minimal overhead.
