 Summary:

* Attention is a limited resource and can be easily disrupted by irrelevant information or stimuli.
* There are several types of attention including selective, divided, and sustained attention.
* Cognitive overload occurs when there is too much information to process at once, leading to decreased performance and productivity.
* Designing for attention involves minimizing distractions, providing clear instructions, and allowing users to focus on one task at a time.
* For screen readers and sighted users, it's important to consider what you're asking people's attention to do and to carefully manage their cognitive load.
* The website <https://howiexperiencewebtoday.com/> provides a good example of how not to design for attention.

## Server Driven UI on Mobile • JJ Qi • GOTO 2020

URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtSfG8tYRdg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtSfG8tYRdg)

 * Server-driven UI is a design pattern where the layout and behavior of a user interface are controlled by a server rather than locally on the client.
* This approach can be useful for implementing complex features or for providing dynamic content to users.
* To convert a feature to be server driven, you will need to do the following:
  * Design an api that serves json data for your feature.
  * Write client-side code to consume this json and render the ui based on it.
  * Set up a way to test your implementation to ensure it's working correctly.
* When deciding whether or not to convert a feature to be server driven, consider the following:
  * Is it always going to be worth the work to convert a feature to be server driven?
  * What are some of the best ways to test your ui is it sufficient to have just unit tests or do we still need full end-to-end ui tests?
* Some benefits of using server-driven UI include:
  * It allows you to decouple your front-end and back-end code, making it easier to maintain.
  * It enables you to provide dynamic content to users without having to update the client-side code.
  * It can improve the performance of your application by reducing the amount of data that needs to be downloaded to the client.

 - GDP is a measure of economic activity, but it doesn't account for many important factors such as environmental damage or quality of life.
- There are alternative ways to measure prosperity, such as the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) and the Happy Planet Index (HPI).
- Businesses have access to vast amounts of personal data, which they use to manipulate and influence people's behavior.
- People should be aware of state-dependent learning, which suggests that the state you are in when you learn something is the best state for retrieving that information later. Therefore, if you want to remember something, it's helpful to recreate the same state when you learned it (e.g., eating and drinking the same things).

## Persuasive Design • Anders Toxboe • GOTO 2018

URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OA--3GoWso](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OA--3GoWso)

 - Persuasive design is the practice of designing interfaces that influence user behavior.
- It can be used to manipulate users (coercion) or facilitate intrinsic motivation (persuasion).
- Coercion involves using persuasive techniques to get users to do something they might not otherwise want to do, while persuasion is about helping users achieve their own goals.
- Persuasive design can be used for both short-term and long-term user engagement.
- Short-term engagement tactics include things like rewards, social proof, and loss aversion, while long-term engagement tactics involve creating a sense of autonomy, competence, and relatedness in users.
- To use persuasive design effectively, it's important to understand the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation.
- Extrinsic motivation comes from external factors like rewards or social pressure, while intrinsic motivation comes from within and is driven by a desire to achieve a goal for its own sake.
- Persuasive design can be used to create interfaces that encourage users to engage in positive behaviors, such as exercising regularly or eating healthy foods.
- However, it's important to use persuasive design ethically and responsibly, as it can also be used to manipulate users into making decisions that may not be in their best interests.
- To ensure that persuasive design is used ethically, it's important to be transparent with users about how their data is being collected and used, and to give them control over their own behavior.


## How to Balance Tech, Content & Location for the Ultimate UX in Mixed Reality • Jason Yim • GOTO 2017

URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTVqkCV56gk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTVqkCV56gk)

 * AR experiences can be impacted by the user's position and movement
* Calibration can help to address this issue, but it may not always be practical or reliable
* One solution is to have a designated area for the AR experience, where users can calibrate their device beforehand
* Another approach is to use computer vision techniques to track objects in the environment and adjust the AR accordingly
* However, these methods also have limitations and challenges, such as requiring specific lighting conditions or being affected by other objects in the environment.
