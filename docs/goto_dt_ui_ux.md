## White-Hat Attention Jacking for Accessibility, Fun & Profit • Chris Atherton • GOTO 2022

URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwocXCyOieM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwocXCyOieM)

 * Attention is a limited resource and can be easily distracted
* Visual attention has three dimensions: what, where, and when
* The "gutenberg diagram" describes how people read text on a page, with the primary optical area (POA) being the most important
* People spend 80% of their time looking at the left half of the screen and 20% on the right
* F-shaped pattern is common in web reading where users scan in an F shape, focusing on headlines and subheadings
* Attention jacking is a technique used to grab user's attention by interrupting their flow with something unexpected or interesting
* Images are processed faster than text and can be used to guide user's attention
* Visual hierarchy is important for guiding user's attention, with larger and bolder elements being more noticeable
* Attention is not just visual, but also auditory, and can be easily distracted by sounds
* Screen reader users have a linear flow of attention and cannot skip around like sighted users
* Tips for designing for screen readers include getting to the point, prioritizing content carefully, and not auto-playing media
* Howie experience website is an example of bad design that fails to consider user's attention.

## Did We(b Development) Lose the Right Direction? • Stefan Judis • GOTO 2021

URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PmPkZJ22Cc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PmPkZJ22Cc)

 * The speaker, Stefan Judis, discusses the complexity of modern web development and the impact it has on user experience.
* He mentions that when he first started doing web development in 2010, a "hello world" website was only 10 kilobytes, but now it is 40 kilobytes.
* The speaker also mentions that setting up a simple site project now requires knowledge of frameworks and bundlers such as webpack, which can be difficult to debug and understand for new developers.
* He brings up the example of tinyhelpers.dev, a website he built where users can add their own tools in the form of JSON files. However, to do so, they have to download 700 megabytes worth of javascript pipeline, which is excessive.
* The speaker also mentions that there seems to be a divide in front-end development between those who focus on javascript driven frameworks and those who care about UX and CSS architecture.
* He argues that developers are prioritizing their own job satisfaction over the needs of users, by using the latest and greatest technologies instead of focusing on user experience.
* The speaker then talks about his own journey in web development, starting with a cutting edge javascript framework for three years, then moving to a pure approach, reducing page weight by 64% and build time by four minutes.
* He mentions that he no longer has a javascript pipeline and if he needs javascript he puts in custom elements from github or elsewhere.
* The speaker also mentions that after rebuilding his site using a pure approach, he has an entire green lighthouse score because he didn't add anything that makes it slow.
* He concludes by saying "use whatever makes you happy" but to consider the trade-offs that come with certain technology choices and to focus on building sites that just work instead of worrying about the technology powering them.

[Note: The speaker does not provide any context for his talk, it is assumed that he is speaking from his own experience and knowledge in web development.]


## How Technology Influences Our Decisions • Chris Atherton & Fabio Pereira • GOTO 2019

 * The internet has changed the way we communicate and access information, but it also has its downsides such as addiction and misinformation.
* Social media platforms can be addictive due to their variable reward systems, which activate the brain's dopamine pathways.
* Social media algorithms prioritize engagement over accuracy, leading to the spread of misinformation and fake news.
* The internet has also led to a decline in face-to-face communication, which is important for building trust and empathy.
* To combat addiction and misinformation, we need to be more conscious about how we use technology and prioritize real-life connections over digital ones.
* Designers have a responsibility to create technology that is ethical and promotes well-being.
* We should also be critical of the information we consume online and verify it through multiple sources.
* Social media platforms can be used for positive change, such as raising awareness about social issues and mobilizing communities.
* The internet has made it easier to connect with people from different cultures and backgrounds, but it has also led to a decline in empathy and understanding.
* We need to find a balance between using technology and prioritizing real-life connections.
* Freezing time in 1993, when the internet was still text-based and slower-paced, would be ideal for some.
* Reconnecting with nature and prioritizing real-life connections are important elements to bring from the past to the present and future.

## Server Driven UI on Mobile • JJ Qi • GOTO 2020

URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtSfG8tYRdg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtSfG8tYRdg)

 * Server-driven UI allows for dynamic and customizable user interfaces by specifying templates on the backend that are then rendered on the frontend.
* This approach can be useful for A/B testing, dynamic messaging, and customized user setups.
* To implement server-driven UI, it is helpful to start with a specific use case and define a template for that use case.
* It can be beneficial to begin with a static JSON contract and gradually build out the backend implementation as needed.
* Some considerations when implementing server-driven UI include determining whether it is always worth the effort to convert a feature to be server-driven, and deciding on the best ways to test the UI.

 * Social media platforms have a responsibility to design for how people are, not how they want people to be
* The attention economy is real and it's impacting our brains in negative ways
* We need to be more mindful of the time we spend on social media and the actions we take while using these platforms
* Designers should use behavioral mechanics for good, not to manipulate users into addictive behaviors
* Transparency is important in design, especially when it comes to data privacy
* Self-care is crucial for designers and users alike, including taking breaks from social media and practicing good digital hygiene
* State dependent learning teaches us that the state we are in when we learn something is the best state for retrieving that information later, so it's important to practice self-care in order to retain information.

URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWIfnPc1wC0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWIfnPc1wC0)

 * The speaker is discussing the importance of fostering a DevUX culture within teams.
* DevUX stands for developer user experience and refers to the practice of involving developers in the design process to create better user experiences.
* The speaker emphasizes that trust is the foundation of any successful team, and it is essential to build this trust in order to grow and improve as a team.
* To build trust, the speaker suggests starting by breaking the ice with designers and sharing vulnerabilities. This can help create empathy and understanding between developers and designers.
* The speaker also recommends organizing regular DevUX drinks or other social events where developers and designers can get to know each other and share their experiences.
* By building trust and fostering a culture of collaboration, teams can create better user experiences and improve their overall productivity and success.
* The speaker mentions the Five Dysfunctions of a Team by Patrick Lencioni as a useful resource for understanding how to build trust and improve team dynamics.

## Persuasive Design • Anders Toxboe • GOTO 2018

URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OA--3GoWso](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OA--3GoWso)

 * Persuasive design is the practice of designing interfaces and experiences to influence user behavior
* There are two types of motivation: intrinsic and extrinsic
	+ Extrinsic motivation comes from external factors such as points, levels, badges, and scoreboards
	+ Intrinsic motivation is driven by internal factors such as curiosity, mastery, and getting feedback on work
* Intrinsic motivation is more sustainable and leads to long-term engagement, while extrinsic motivation is more short-lived
* To design for intrinsic motivation, it's important to understand user goals and align them with business goals
* One way to facilitate intrinsic motivation is through appropriate challenges, which can be achieved by using the flow channel concept from Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi
	+ The flow channel is a balance between skill level and challenge, where the challenge is just enough to keep the user engaged without causing anxiety or boredom
* Persuasive design can be used to seduce users to sign up, get them to start using a product, and facilitate ongoing engagement
* It's important to use persuasive design in an ethical way, by focusing on facilitating intrinsic motivation rather than manipulating or coercing users
* The persuasive continuum is a tool for determining the level of influence a design has, ranging from coercion to seduction to facilitation.


## How to Balance Tech, Content & Location for the Ultimate UX in Mixed Reality • Jason Yim • GOTO 2017

URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yQvwgRJSbc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yQvwgRJSbc)

 * Lean UX is a practice that emphasizes collaboration, customer feedback, and rapid iteration.
* Nordstrom has been using lean UX for about two years.
* The company started by incorporating developers into the design process from the beginning.
* Developers are involved in usability sketching, bringing products to life, attending usability sessions, and looking at software with customers.
* Lean UX has helped Nordstrom become more data-driven and make better decisions about what to build.
* The practice has also helped the company move faster and be more agile.
* It took about six to nine months for leadership to fully understand and support lean UX.
* Design sprints have been used at Nordstrom to quickly gather information and create MVPs.
* The next step after paper prototyping depends on the project, but generally it's best to move to a wireframe or interaction design as quickly as possible.
* There are many tools available to help with rapid prototyping.
* Lean UX is not a perfect science and requires experimentation and iteration.
* It's important to involve developers in the design process from the beginning.
* Customer feedback is crucial for making informed decisions about what to build.
* Lean UX can help companies become more data-driven, agile, and customer-focused.

 * ClipPadding and ClipChildren can be used to draw over parents and paddings
* ViewOverlay is a best friend for animations, allowing you to draw over the whole layer hierarchy
* Shared element transition doesn't allow user control without events, but can be achieved with single activity and creating your own navigation
* Fast animations can hide any problem with implementation
* Repo with code is available for reference
* Nick Butcher's Plaid application has more examples of smoke and mirrors techniques.


## Emergent Design • Neal Ford • GOTO 2013

URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqmiUJtxaF4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqmiUJtxaF4)

 * Evolutionary architecture and emergent design require good engineering practices
* TDD codebase makes it easier to do exercises for refactoring
* Predicting the future leads to over-engineering, which is a bad thing
* Prefer being proactive about things that are known to happen in the future and instantly reactive as things happen in the code base
* Combination of proactive and reactive works better than trying to get better at predicting the future
* Good engineering practices include:
	+ Automated testing
	+ Continuous integration
	+ Code reviews
	+ Version control
	+ Refactoring
	+ Short iterations
	+ Regular releases
	+ Simple design
	+ Small teams
	+ Collocation
	+ Face-to-face communication
* Anti-patterns:
	+ Analysis paralysis - overthinking and not taking action
	+ Gold plating - adding unnecessary features or functionality
	+ Over-engineering - making something more complex than it needs to be
	+ Premature optimization - optimizing before it's necessary
	+ Cargo culting - following practices without understanding why they are being used
* Last responsible moment - the point at which a decision must be made, but not before
* Inflection points in complexity over time on a project indicate that a component may have taken on too many responsibilities
* Spikes - experimental coding exercises to determine to get rid of uncertainty for things like estimates
* Give me estimates now anti-pattern - speculating about how long something will take without enough information leads to ironclad contracts and risking lives to meet deadlines
* Agile architects need a better awareness of current events in the code base to make determinations about last responsible moments and inflection points
* Evolutionary architecture and emergent design are about finding and harvesting idiomatic patterns, taking a design that is too complicated to build with the tools available and flipping it over backwards to build something simpler
* Pac-man example of anti object approach - all intelligence built into the maze, not the individual pac-man guy, using pac-man smell and decaying quickly to determine ghost movement
* Objects should do the opposite of what you think they should be doing as a way of modeling something that's simpler
* Anti objects are inspired by the real world but go too far in creating objects that mimic reality
* Simple design is key - "the art of maximizing the amount of work not done" - Agile Manifesto
* Small teams, collocation, and face-to-face communication are important for good engineering practices
* Version control, automated testing, continuous integration, code reviews, refactoring, short iterations, regular releases, simple design, and keeping things as small as possible are all part of good engineering practices.


## Why UX is not only the Responsibility of the UX'er • Janne Jul Jensen • GOTO 2015

URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbu6G08n_Gw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbu6G08n_Gw)

 * UX is about designing software that meets user needs and expectations
* Good UX can increase user satisfaction, reduce errors, and improve productivity
* Key principles of good UX design include simplicity, consistency, feedback, flexibility, and error prevention
* To evaluate the UX of a product, consider its usability, accessibility, desirability, and value
* Usability testing is an important part of evaluating UX, and can be done at any stage of development
* Remote usability testing is a cost-effective way to test UX with real users
* Legal terms and conditions can be presented in a less intrusive way that doesn't interfere with the user experience
* Developers who care about UX but are facing time pressure should try to raise awareness of the importance of UX among their colleagues and management
* If raising awareness is not effective, consider looking for a job at a company that values good UX design.


## Adaptive UI • Sam Davies • GOTO 2015

URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QA9IYB67o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QA9IYB67o)

 * Adaptive Layout is a way to create layouts that work on different screen sizes and orientations
* Auto Layout is a tool used to create Adaptive Layout
* Use the "Vary for Traits" button in Interface Builder to create size class overrides
* Start with a base layout and override for specific size classes
* Use stack views to make layout easier, they work well with adaptivity
* Tips for using Adaptive Layout:
	+ Get to know Auto Layout
	+ Use Adaptive Layout for broad strokes layouts
	+ Always start with a base layout and override
	+ Life is easier with stack views
	+ Now is the time to get Adaptive
* Questions:
	+ How do you deal with assignments that want everything pixel perfect?
		- It's a challenge, but it's important to educate designers that pixel perfect designs are not always possible or practical for multiple screen sizes and orientations. Content is the most important thing, and the layout should be designed to best present that content in different situations.

## UX for Mobile • Chris Atherton • GOTO 2014

URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ByPrFldN8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ByPrFldN8)

 * Attention is a limited resource
* We can only attend to a small portion of our visual field at once, and we tend to focus on the center of our vision
* The order in which information is presented affects how we perceive it
* Context matters - people need help remembering where they are and what they're doing, especially if there are big changes to the interface
* Mobile first design can be beneficial even for non-mobile applications because it forces designers to focus on what's truly important
* Toggle buttons can be confusing because it's unclear whether they show an action or a state
* Using cheap attentional tricks like making something flash or blink can help draw people's attention to where you want it to go
* There may be some things that are too complex to be shown on a small screen, but breaking down complex tasks into smaller screens can help
* Sound and touch follow similar attentional rules as vision, but smell is less filtered and can remind us of past experiences.

 * Agile development process
* Two-week sprints
* Standups every morning to discuss what was done the previous day and what will be worked on that day
* Planning poker to estimate story points for each task
* Stories are broken down into tasks, which are then assigned point values based on complexity and effort required
* Velocity is calculated by adding up the total points of completed stories in a sprint
* Retrospectives are held at the end of each sprint to discuss what went well and what could be improved
* Code reviews are done before code is merged into the main branch
* QA testing is done throughout the sprint, not just at the end
* Design and user experience are considered from the beginning of the project
* Collaboration between developers, designers, and product managers is encouraged
* Weekly check-ins with clients to ensure alignment with their goals and expectations
* Flexibility to adjust the plan as needed based on new information or changes in priorities
* Focus on delivering value to the end user
* Education process for clients to help them understand what features will provide the most value for the product
* Velocity is used to estimate when features will be completed
* Refactoring and bug fixing are done throughout the project, not just at the end

 * Danske Bank's mobile app development process was not a textbook one
* The initial goal of the project was to create an iPhone and Android app for basic banking services, such as transfers between own accounts, transfers within the bank, transfers to other banks, and payments
* The team consisted of 7-8 people and the development period was from May to September
* Danske Bank already had a backend infrastructure in place which helped speed up the development process
* The app was developed using an agile approach with two week sprints
* The team used a middleware development to piggyback on the bank's existing backend infrastructure
* In addition to internal testing, the team also did user testing once the NDA expired
* The team tested the app on multiple devices and operating systems using Less Painful, a spin-off company that created a test procedure for hooking in multiple phones and running test scenarios
* Users' expectations have changed over the years and they have become increasingly demanding as they see more and more apps and move more of their digital world onto mobile phones
* Danske Bank now has more users on their app than they do on their mobile website
* The app has been successful in Denmark with 5.5 million people, 1.5 million of whom have downloaded the app
* The app has also been successful in other countries such as Sweden, Norway, Finland, Ireland and England
* The app has received positive press and high ratings on both iPhone and Android platforms
* The original team that developed the app consisted of developers, UX, and graphic designers who all tested the app continuously using standardized test cases
* Danske Bank now has 50 internal testers who test the app on an ongoing basis.

 * The speaker is discussing user-centered design methods.
* User-centered design is about understanding the user and their needs, and designing with those in mind.
* It's important to involve users in the design process as early as possible.
* One method for doing this is through paper prototyping tests, where you create a rough version of your design on paper and test it with users.
* This allows you to get feedback on your design before investing too much time and resources into it.
* Another method is through use cases and user stories, which help you understand how users will interact with your system.
* It's important to involve stakeholders in the design process as well, to ensure that their needs are also being met.
* One way to do this is by creating a sitemap or workflow of what you want on your website or app, and getting input from stakeholders on what should be included.
* The speaker emphasizes the importance of testing early and often in the design process.
* They also mention that it's important to involve users and stakeholders in the design process as much as possible.
* The speaker encourages using a variety of user-centered design methods, including paper prototyping tests, use cases and user stories, and sitemaps or workflows.
* They also suggest looking at competitors and related fields for inspiration.
* It's important to remember that the goal is not necessarily to come up with something completely new, but to create something that works well for your users and stakeholders.

 Here are the notes from the video transcript in bullet point form, written as if I am a student attending the conference:

- The speaker has a lot of experience in the field and has worked in various roles such as industry, academia, and research.
- They have always struggled with making difficult topics easy to understand for students who don't have any industrial experience.
- Their main interest is in design, which was also their PhD research topic.
- The speaker shares a scenario about teaching a difficult design concept in their data structures class.
- A student named Chris comes to the speaker's office to show them his code for a program he has been working on.
- The speaker admits that they can't guess what the code does and asks Chris to explain it to them.
- Chris struggles to explain the code, so the speaker uses an analogy of a younger sister named Stephanie who is learning how to program.
- They ask Chris if he thinks Stephanie could read and understand his code, implying that it's too difficult for someone without much experience.
- The speaker then asks Chris to imagine a scenario where both he and Stephanie work at the same company in the future, and she is asked to maintain this complex code.
- They emphasize the importance of writing code that can be understood by others, including oneself in the future.
- The speaker suggests that when writing code, one should write it as if a smart programmer will look at it and appreciate its elegance and beauty.
- They challenge Chris to rewrite his code in a beautiful way, like a song that sings.
- The speaker implies that they might start grading on the beauty of code.
- Chris gets the point and leaves to make the world a better place.

Overall, the speaker emphasizes the importance of making complex concepts accessible to students with no industrial experience, using design as an example. They also stress the significance of writing clear, elegant, and beautiful code that can be understood by others. The use of analogies and scenarios helps make their point more relatable and engaging for the audience.

 * Anoto's technology is based on digital pens and paper
* The company has been around for 15 years, started as a spin-off from Ericsson
* Anoto's technology uses microdots to track the position of the pen on the paper
* The dots are printed in a pattern that covers the entire surface of the paper
* The pens have a small camera that reads the pattern and sends the data to a computer or mobile device via Bluetooth
* The company has sold over 20 million pens and has partnerships with major companies such as Nike, Adidas, and Hallmark
* Anoto's technology is used in various industries such as healthcare, education, and retail
* The company is currently working on new products and exploring new markets
* One of the challenges for Anoto is the emergence of capacitive touch technology which is becoming cheaper
* Another challenge is the ergonomic issues with off-screen gestures, as they are not natural or intuitive
* Anoto's new product is a multi-user interactive whiteboard that uses object recognition to track multiple pens at once
* The whiteboard can recognize different objects such as pens, erasers and fingers
* It has a 60 inch screen and can be used for collaboration, brainstorming and presentations
* Anoto's technology is also being used in the disability space, allowing people with disabilities to write using their elbows or other body parts
* The company is not actively working on standardizing gestures but sees the value in it.
