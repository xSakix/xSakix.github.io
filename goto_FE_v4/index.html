<li>Microfrontends are a way to divide a single-page application into smaller, independent applications called "microfrontends".</li>
<li>The application shell is responsible for loading microfrontends and routing URLs.</li>
<li>A challenge with microfrontends is that they may require different frameworks or libraries in each part.</li>
<li>Module Federation is a webpack plugin that allows multiple microfrontends to be loaded into the same application, sharing dependencies.</li>
<li>Iframes can also be used as a way to isolate different parts of an application, providing security benefits.</li>
<li>Web components provide a way to create reusable, customizable UI components that can be shared across different microfrontends or applications.</li>
<li>The concept of "evolutionary architecture" allows for the gradual evolution of an application's structure and components as business needs change over time.</li>

<li>Accessibility is important for everyone, including those with disabilities.</li>
<li>Web accessibility involves considering navigation, auditory and visual cues, motor capabilities, and cognitive aspects.</li>
<li>Writing accessible JavaScript involves using HTML semantics, setting CSS properties appropriately, and targeting specific elements with Javascript.</li>
<li>Use the <code>aria-*</code> attributes to provide additional information about an element's purpose or state.</li>
<li>Test your code for accessibility by manually navigating through it, using automated tools like Lighthouse and Wave, and testing with screen readers like ChromeVox and VoiceOver.</li>
<li>Follow an accessibility checklist while writing code to ensure you don't miss any important aspects.</li>
<li>Use semantic HTML elements instead of generic containers (e.g., use <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> instead of a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>) to make your code more accessible.</li>
<li>Consider keyboard navigation, including skip navigation links and tab index attributes, when designing your website's layout and functionality.</li>

<li><strong>Introduction to HTTP/3</strong></li>
<li>HP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) has evolved over time, with the latest version being HP/3.</li>
<li><strong>HP/3 vs Previous Versions</strong> </li>
<li>HP/3 is designed for better performance and security compared to its predecessors.</li>
<li>It uses a new transport protocol called QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) which is built on top of UDP instead of TCP.</li>
<li>Unlike HTTP/2, HP/3 does not use multiplexing, instead it sends data in independent streams.</li>
<li><strong>QUIC Protocol</strong> </li>
<li>QUIC is a transport protocol designed to improve performance and security over the internet.</li>
<li>It uses UDP as its base protocol and adds features like encryption, congestion control, and error recovery.</li>
<li><strong>Key Features of HP/3</strong></li>
<li>Improved Performance: QUIC eliminates the need for TCP's three-way handshake, allowing faster connection establishment.</li>
<li>Security: All communication over QUIC is encrypted by default, providing better security than TCP or HTTP/2.</li>
<li>Independent Streams: In HP/3, each request and response is sent as a separate stream, allowing for more efficient use of network resources.</li>
<li><strong>Deployment Challenges</strong> </li>
<li>Organizations may need to update their firewalls and network infrastructure to support QUIC traffic.</li>
<li>Some ISPs still block UDP traffic due to its association with DDoS attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Future of HP/3</strong> </li>
<li>HP/3 is expected to become widely adopted in the coming years, as more browsers and servers implement support for it.</li>
<li>It may also lead to the development of new application protocols that take advantage of QUIC's features.</li>

<li>Attention is a key factor in user experience design and can be influenced by various factors such as visual weight, contrast, movement, and layout.</li>
<li>Inattentional blindness occurs when people fail to notice unexpected changes or events in their environment due to focused attention on a specific task or object.</li>
<li>Designing for cognitive difficulties like ADHD and bipolar disorder involves understanding the challenges these individuals face in managing their attention and resisting distractions.</li>
<li>Reading comprehension can be hindered by factors such as low vision, contrast issues, and animations that distract from the text content.</li>
