<li>Hyper CLI is a tool inspired by 40-year-old technology, hypercard, allowing users to program one machine.</li>
<li>It's a repurposed curl with memory, more advanced and capable of handling formats like HTML, JSON, and forms.</li>
<li>The DSL for programming the web is called hyper Lang, which can inspect and manipulate responses from websites.</li>
<li>Hyper Lang is a low code/no code tool that simplifies programming without sacrificing functionality.</li>
<li>It uses a natural and understandable DSL inspired by Flomatic and Cobalt.</li>
<li>The tool can run tests on APIs with configuration files for different environments.</li>
<li>Using HTTP as an interface enables interaction with various services, promoting easy changes and adaptability.</li>
<li>Hyper Lang supports multiple industries' APIs through HTTP interactions.</li>
<li>Roy Fielding's work focuses on creating a stable internet system that adapts to change.</li>

<li>A tool handles various authentication methods like SOAP, OAuth, and basic auth with a simple scripting language called Hyper Ling.</li>
<li>Plugins are automatically loaded during startup, making them convenient but potentially dangerous due to the use of eval statement.</li>
<li>Future improvements include hardening code, modularization, better error handling, and more plugin support.</li>
<li>Potential for domain-specific languages (DSLs) and integration with other programming languages.</li>

<li>Stephanie Stimac's book, "Design for Developers," teaches developers the basics of design to improve communication and collaboration with designers.</li>
<li>The goal is to help developers identify issues in user interfaces and fix them efficiently without wasting resources or time.</li>
<li>Design smartness is emphasized, where developers learn about design concepts but don't become experts, allowing for better teamwork with designers.</li>
<li>The book covers topics like typography, color theory, layouts, and user experience to help developers build polished designs.</li>
<li>It also highlights the importance of designers learning about development and vice versa.</li>
<li>The approach is flexible depending on the context of work.</li>
<li>The book covers design fundamentals, research, UX design, web layout, typography, color theory, testing, and iteration.</li>
<li>Color theory is an interesting aspect of design, considering psychology, cultural connotations, and accessibility concerns.</li>
<li>Browser extensions or developer tools can help identify colorblindness issues.</li>
<li>Understanding individual and collective perceptions plays a role in design preferences.</li>
<li>Valid reasons should be behind feedback rather than personal preferences.</li>
<li>Design should cater to the target audience, not just stakeholders' opinions.</li>
<li>The book discusses the importance of understanding color theory and its application in designing effective experiences.</li>
<li>Collaboration between different roles in product development is crucial for better products and more effective teamwork.</li>

<li>Increasing complexity in web applications necessitates better tools and architecture.</li>
<li>Three main challenges: managing complexity, ensuring reactivity, and scaling across teams.</li>
<li>Unidirectional data flow (Flux) is a solution to handle state, views, and actions.</li>
<li>Multiple Flux implementations exist, including Redux which is popular nowadays.</li>
<li>A simple web shop example demonstrates how Flux works with multiple stores managing different aspects of the application.</li>

<li>Disadvantages: harder to manage complex actions, testing difficulties due to dependencies between stores.</li>
<li>Compare advantages and disadvantages of classical MVC approaches vs Flux architecture.</li>
<li>Flux has better state management, testability, and server-side rendering.</li>
<li>Redux eliminates mutable state problems and offers functional composition, snapshot replay, and efficient rendering.</li>
<li>Immutable data types can help prevent accidental modifications but may have a steep learning curve.</li>

<li>Psycho JS is a small library for frontend frameworks that uses message passing, input/output logic, and streams for asynchronous programming.</li>
<li>Stream IO separates logic from effects by treating them as data, similar to monadic I/O in Haskell. It uses generators for pausing and resuming execution.</li>
<li>Haskell's original stream IO was an April Fool's joke, making it unsuitable for transformational programs.</li>
<li>The history of computer programming has seen a shift from transformational systems (90s) to reactive systems. Haskell moved from stream IO to monadic IO in the late 90s.</li>
<li>Psycho JS is a JavaScript framework with message passing, input/output logic, and streams for asynchronous programming. Cycle.js has asynchronous message passing, suitable for user interfaces or reactive systems but not question-and-answer interactions. Elm Architecture handles complex requests and responses using tasks.</li>
<li>Message passing can be combined with monadic IO in Elm. Flux and Redux have unidirectional data flow but lack a purely functional approach.</li>
<li>Languages like Elm, Closure, Dart, etc., focus on asynchronous programming and message passing. Cycle JS is event-driven and message-passing concurrency.</li>
<li>Enforcing developers to avoid creating their own effects can be done with tools like ESLint plugins or by writing a language optimized for the framework.</li>
<li>Bind and flatMap are implemented in hacky JavaScript monadic IO, which may not be ideal for reactive UI. Haskell has functional reactive programming libraries.</li>
<li>Consider using TypeScript with Angular to benefit from its type checking and self-documenting code. Elm is a purely functional language with zero runtime errors.</li>

<li>Common strategies to improve loading time: Inline critical CSS, split into multiple files, use local storage or CDNs.</li>
<li>Challenges with CSS complexity: Positioning, formatting context, specificity, cascade inheritance.</li>
<li>Solution: Learn CSS thoroughly and understand its architecture for larger web applications.</li>
<li>Minification techniques: Regular expressions (regex) or partial parsing. Complex properties like shorthand background declarations require more advanced parsers.</li>
<li>The speaker discusses CSS refactoring issues and the need for a unifier. They mention using regular expressions, parsers, and abstract syntax trees to improve minification. A new tool called CSS Shrink is introduced.</li>
<li>Minify CSS code by removing unnecessary characters and optimizing syntax. Consistency is key for better Gzip compression. Remove empty rules, duplicate declarations, and invalid properties. Merge adjacent selectors with the same content. Strip generic font families from CSS. Validate CSS to ensure proper syntax and value usage.</li>
<li>Avoid manipulating CSS with JavaScript as it can break optimizations. Optimize CSS by removing duplicate keyframes, using shorter names for variables, and converting units. Use browser-specific CSS to reduce page load size. Test CSS transformations with tools like CSS diff and PhantomJS. Explore object-oriented CSS, SMACSS, and CSS for grown-ups/grumpy old men. Continue experimenting with CSS transforms and minification techniques.</li>
