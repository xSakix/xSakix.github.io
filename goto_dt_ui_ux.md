 - Software engineer and former HCI researcher discusses roles of interaction designers, visual designers, and UX professionals.
- UX encompasses various areas and cannot be handled by one person; it's a complex process involving specialists.
- Treating UX as a magical solution to fix problems is criticized; organizations should consider it from the beginning with appropriate budget.
- Ideal UX process includes research, design, testing, and communication.
- UX should be integrated into an organization's structure and processes.
- UX is a compromise between user needs, business goals, technology, and budget constraints.
- Maslow's hierarchy of needs emphasizes meeting basic needs before focusing on higher-level requirements; applies to users: data/content, interaction design, visual appeal.
- Stakeholders have different interests affecting the UX process.
- Examples include over-collecting user data, forcing unwanted products, and bundling unrelated software with popular programs.
- These practices can damage a company's reputation and trust.
- Factors within an organization impacting UX: marketing, legal departments, visual designers, developers, performance, simplicity, security.
- Long passwords with two known characters improve usability without compromising security.
- Automated remote usability testing saves money while maintaining quality.
- Accepting legal terms can be made less intrusive like Facebook's approach.
- For developers under time pressure, raise awareness about UX importance and consider working at a place that values it more.
- Evaluating UX of an organization with questionnaires is subjective; focus on improving the overall experience.

 1. Adaptive UI for iOS: Design for 12 different form factors with size classes.
2. Apple introduced Adaptive Layout in iOS 8, abstracting layouts from specific device sizes using size classes (compact/regular) in two dimensions (horizontal/vertical).
3. Maps to real devices: iPads are always regular, while iPhones have varying compactness based on orientation and model.
4. Adaptive Layout is a feature in iOS 8 and later, supporting different size classes.
5. Size classes divide space into compact (limited room) and regular (plenty of room).
6. With iOS 9, multitasking allows apps to run with different size class configurations on iPads.

8. The goal is to create one storyboard that works across all devices without needing multiple storyboards.
9. Use adaptivity to handle multiple device layouts. Content is more important than pixel-perfect designs.
10. Get familiar with stack views in iOS 9. They make life easier, especially when nested together.

 1. Attention is crucial for processing visual information, with two main pathways: the dorsal pathway focusing on spatial orientation and movement, and the ventral pathway identifying objects.
2. Damage to these areas can lead to issues like hemispatial neglect or Alzheimer's disease.
3. Attention management is vital for brain functions, including web design, where clear calls-to-action and simple interfaces are essential.
4. Visual illusions help understand how we infer things based on experiences.
5. Mobile usability should prioritize attention by providing clear call-to-actions and focusing on important elements.
6. Novelty and movement can attract our attention, making it crucial to design interfaces that maintain focus.
7. Attention is vital in web design, as it determines how users interact with a website.
8. Designers should simplify websites around user needs rather than showcasing all features.
9. Dark patterns are exploitative designs that take advantage of attention and can be found in mobile interfaces.
10. Google's search engine serves as an example of a well-designed UI with simple interface and effective functionality.
11. Designing the perfect UI requires managing attention and directing users to the right actions.
12. Inattentional blindness can lead to missing important details, while change blindness causes loss of specifics in discontinuous vision.
13. Mobile attention is brief, making it challenging for designers to keep users engaged with their apps.
14. UI failures often result from poor attention management and not directing users to the right actions at the right time.
15. Change blindness and inattentional blindness affect mobile attention.

19. Mobile devices act as an outboard brain, helping with heavy lifting and memory.
20. Consider context when designing user interfaces for different platforms.
21. No significant difference in adult male or female attention has been found. Children have a lower capacity to attend multiple things at once.
22. Sex differences in attention: significant overlap, adults have greater capacity than children.
23. Children's brains are still developing, making them less attentive to multiple things.
24. Senses like sound and touch follow similar rules as vision but smell is more immediate.
25. Using visual tricks like flashing or blinking can help direct attention on small screens.
26. Complexity of content depends on the context; some may require large screens for efficient monitoring.
